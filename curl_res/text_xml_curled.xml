The European Council concluded that digital transformation offers immense opportunities for innovation, growth and jobs, will contribute to our global competitiveness, and will enhance creative and cultural diversity. Seizing those opportunities requires collectively tackling some of the challenges posed by the digital transformation and reviewing policies affected by the digital transformation.</p>

The European Council invited the Commission to put forward a European approach to AI by early 2018 and called on the Commission to put forward the necessary initiatives to strengthen the framework conditions with a view to enabling the Union to explore new markets through risk-based radical innovations and to reaffirming the leading role of its industry.</p>

European Digital Innovation Hubs should serve as access points for the latest digital capacities, including HPC, AI, cybersecurity, as well as for other existing innovative technologies such as key enabling technologies, available also in fablabs or citylabs. European Digital Innovation Hubs should act as single-entry points in accessing tested and validated technologies and should promote open innovation. They should also provide support in the area of advanced digital skills, for example by coordinating with education providers for the provision of short-term training for workers and internships for students. The network of European Digital Innovation Hubs should ensure broad geographical coverage across Europe and should contribute to the participation of the outermost regions in the Digital Single Market.</p>

To that end, Member States should be free to propose candidates in accordance with their national procedures and national administrative and institutional structures. The Commission should take the utmost account of the opinion of each Member State before selecting a European Digital Innovation Hub in the territory of that Member State. Entities which already carry out functions as digital innovation hubs in the context of the Digitising European Industry Initiative could be designated by Member States as candidates as a result of an open and competitive process. The Commission should be able to involve independent external experts in the selection process. The Commission and the Member States should avoid the unnecessary duplication of competences and functions at Union and national level. There should therefore be adequate flexibility when designating the hubs and determining their activities and composition. In order to ensure a broad geographical coverage across Europe, as well as a balance of coverage of technologies and sectors, the network might be further enlarged through a subsequent open and competitive process.</p>

The European Council also asked the Commission, the Council and the Member States to examine possible measures to address the skills challenges linked to digitisation, cybersecurity, media literacy and AI and to address the need for an inclusive, lifelong-learning-based and innovation-driven approach to education and training. In response, the Commission presented on 17 January 2018 a first package of measures, addressing key competences, digital skills, common values and inclusive education. In May 2018, a second package of measures was launched, advancing work to build a European Education Area by 2025, which also emphasises the centrality of digital skills. Media literacy includes essential competencies (knowledge, skills and attitudes) that allow citizens to engage effectively with media and other information providers and to develop critical thinking and lifelong learning skills for socialising and becoming active citizens.</p>

In the same way as the deployment of those technologies require a Union response, so does the advanced digital skills dimension. Training opportunities in advanced digital skills, including data protection competencies, need to be scaled up, increased and made accessible throughout the Union. Failing to do that could impede the smooth deployment of advanced digital technologies and could hamper the overall competitiveness of Union’s economy. The actions supported by the Programme are complementary to those supported by the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Erasmus+, each established by a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Horizon Europe. Those actions will target the Union workforce in the private sector as well as the public sector, in particular ICT professionals and other related professionals, as well as students, trainees and trainers. The term ‘workforce’ refers to the economically active population, and includes both workers and self-employed people who are in occupation and unemployed people.</p>

Since a number of services of public interest already have a Union dimension, the support provided to their implementation and deployment at Union level should ensure that citizens and businesses will beable to benefit from access to high-quality digital services across the Union that are, where possible, multilingual. Moreover, Union support in this area is expected to encourage the re-use of public sector information.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The interoperability of European public services concerns all levels of administration: Union, national, regional and local. Besides removing barriers to a functioning internal market, interoperability facilitates cross-border cooperation, the promotion of European standards and the successful implementation of policies, and offers great potential for avoiding cross-border electronic barriers, further securing the emergence of new, and the consolidation of developing, common public services at Union level. In order to eliminate the fragmentation of European public services and to support fundamental freedoms and operational mutual recognition in the Union, a holistic cross-sector and cross-border approach to interoperability should be promoted in the manner that is most effective and is most responsive to end-users. Such an approach implies that interoperability is to be understood in a broad sense, spanning technical and legal layers and encompassing policy elements in the field. Accordingly, the span of activities would go beyond the usual lifecycle of solutions to include all the intervention elements that would support the necessary framework conditions for sustained interoperability at large. The Programme should also facilitate cross-fertilisation between different national initiatives, leading to the development of a digital society.</p>

In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>
