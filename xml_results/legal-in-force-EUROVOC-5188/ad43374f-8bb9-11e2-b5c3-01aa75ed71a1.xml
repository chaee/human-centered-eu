      <p class="normal">Since certain rules of a technical nature have a direct impact on the work of users in the Member States, including the Sirene Bureaux, it is appropriate to include such rules in the Sirene Manual. Therefore Appendices to this Manual shall set out, inter alia, rules on transliteration, code tables, forms for communication of supplementary information and other technical implementing measures for data processing.</p>

      <p class="normal">The catalogue serves to provide legally non-binding recommendations and best practices for Member States in the light of experience. It also serves as a reference tool for evaluation of the correct implementation of the SIS II legal instruments. Accordingly, it should, as far as possible, be followed.</p>

      <p class="normal">Additional tasks may be entrusted to the Sirene Bureaux, in particular, by the national law implementing Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA, Articles 39 and 46 of the Schengen Convention, in as far as they are not replaced by Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA, Article 40 or 41 of the Schengen Convention or if the information falls within the scope of the mutual legal assistance.</p>
      <p class="normal">If a Sirene Bureau receives, from another Sirene Bureau, a request falling outside its competence under national law it should immediately forward it to the competent authority and inform the requesting Sirene Bureau about this action.

      <p class="normal">According to Article 39 of the SIS II Regulation and Article 54 of the SIS II Decision, data processed in SIS II in application of these two legal instruments shall not be transferred or made available to third countries or to international organisations. Article 55 of the SIS II Decision foresees derogation from this general rule regarding the exchange of data on stolen, misappropriated, lost or invalidated passports with Interpol, subject to the conditions laid down in this article.</p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1456-4-1">(b)   Supplementary information</p>
      <p class="normal">In accordance with the ‘data ownership principle’ contained in Article 34(2) of the SIS II Regulation and Article 49(2) of the SIS II Decision, transmission of supplementary information to third countries can only be performed by the Member State ‘owner’ of the data. If a request for supplementary information related to a particular alert is received by the Sirene Bureau of a Member State other than that entering the alert, the former shall inform the latter of the request for information in order to allow the issuing Member State to make a decision in full compliance with the applicable national law, including the rules on data protection. Use of the Interpol channel to third countries will depend on national provisions or procedures.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="normal">Europol has the right to access and to directly search data entered in SIS II according to SIS II Decision Articles 26, 36 and 38. Europol may request further information from the Member States concerned in accordance with the provisions of the Europol Decision<a id="ntc16-L_2013071EN.01000401-E0016" href="#ntr16-L_2013071EN.01000401-E0016"> (<span class="super">16</span>)</a>. In accordance with national law, it is strongly recommended that cooperation with the National Europol Unit (ENU) should be established in order to ensure that the Sirene Bureau is informed of any exchange of supplementary information between Europol and the ENU concerning alerts in SIS II. In exceptional cases where communication at national level concerning SIS II alerts is done by the ENU, all parties to the communication, especially the Sirene Bureau, should be made aware of this fact to avoid confusion.</p>

In accordance with national law, cooperation with them should be established in order to ensure the smooth exchange of information in case of a hit. In particular, the Sirene Bureau should be the contact point for national members of Eurojust and their assistants for supplementary information related to alerts in SIS II.</p>

      <p class="normal">The role of the SIS II is neither to replace nor to replicate the role of Interpol. Although tasks may overlap, the governing principles for action and cooperation between the Member States under Schengen differ substantially from those under Interpol. It is therefore necessary to establish rules for cooperation between the Sirene Bureaux and the NCBs (National Central Bureaux) at the national level.</p>
      <p class="normal">The following principles shall apply:</p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1522-4-1">1.8.1.   <span class="italic">Priority of SIS II alerts over Interpol alerts</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">In case of alerts issued by Member States, SIS II alerts and the exchange of all information on these alerts shall always have priority over alerts and information exchanged via Interpol. This is of particular importance if the alerts conflict.</p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1533-4-1">1.8.2.   <span class="italic">Choice of communication channel</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">The principle of Schengen alerts taking precedence over Interpol alerts issued by Member States shall be respected and it shall be ensured that the NCBs of Member States comply with this. Once the SIS II alert is created, all communication related to the alert and the purpose for its creation and execution of action to be taken shall be provided by Sirene Bureaux. If a Member State wants to change channels of communication, the other parties have to be consulted in advance. Such a change of channel is possible only in specific cases.</p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1544-4-1">1.8.3.   <span class="italic">Use and distribution of Interpol diffusions in Schengen States</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Given the priority of SIS II alerts over Interpol alerts, the use of Interpol alerts shall be restricted to exceptional cases (i.e. where there is no provision, either in the Convention or in technical terms, to enter the alert in the SIS II, or where not all the necessary information is available to form a SIS II alert). Parallel alerts in the SIS II and via Interpol within the Schengen area should be avoided. Alerts which are distributed via Interpol channels and which also cover the Schengen area or parts thereof shall bear the following indication: ‘except for the Schengen States’.</p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e1559-4-1">1.8.4.   <span class="italic">Hit and deletion of an alert</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">In order to ensure the Sirene Bureau’s role as a coordinator of the verification of the quality of the information entered in the SIS II Member States shall ensure that the Sirene Bureaux and the NCBs inform each other of hits and deletion of alerts.</p>

Only if this channel is not available, another adequately secured and appropriate means of communication may be used. The ability to choose the channel means that it shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, according to technical possibilities and the security and quality requirements that the communications have to meet.</p>
      <p class="normal">Written messages shall be divided into two categories: free text and standard forms. Appendix 3 shall describe the forms exchanged between Sirene Bureaux and set out guidance on the expected content of the fields, including whether they are mandatory or not.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="normal">The exchange of information on third-country nationals on whom an alert has been issued under Article 24 of the SIS II Regulation allows Member States to take decisions in the case of entry or visa application. If the individual is already on the territory of the Member State, it allows national authorities to take the appropriate action for issuing residence permits, long-stay visas or expulsion. In this section references to visas concern long-stay visas, unless otherwise clearly explained (e.g. re-entry visa).</p>
      <p class="normal">Carrying out the information procedures laid down under Article 5(4) of the Schengen Borders Code and the consultation procedures laid down under Article 25 of the Schengen Convention, falls within the competence of the authorities responsible for border controls and issuing residence permits or visas. In principle, the Sirene Bureaux shall be involved in these procedures only in order to transmit supplementary information directly related to the alerts (e.g. notification of a hit, clarification of identity) or to delete alerts.</p>
      <p class="normal">However, the Sirene Bureaux may also be involved in transmitting supplementary information necessary for the expulsion of, or for refusing entry to, a third-country national; and may be involved in transmitting any supplementary information further generated by these actions.</p>

Therefore in the case of a hit on a third country national who is the beneficiary of the right of free movement, normal consultation procedures shall be undertaken between Switzerland, the issuing Member State and any other Member State which may hold relevant information on the third country national’s right of free movement.</p>

The entry may be refused if this Member State has issued a national alert for refusal of entry. In both cases, at the request of the competent authority, the Sirene Bureau of the Member State that the person is seeking to enter shall send the Sirene Bureaux of the two Member States in question a message (an <span class="bold">H form</span> if the transit was allowed/a <span class="bold">G form</span> if the entry was refused) informing them of the contradiction and requesting that they consult each other in order to either delete the alert in SIS II or to withdraw the residence permit/visa. It may also request to be informed of the result of any consultation.</p>
      <p class="normal">If the third-country national concerned tries to enter the Member State which has entered the alert in SIS II, his/her entry may be refused by this Member State. However, at the request of the competent authority, the Sirene Bureau of that Member State shall consult the Sirene Bureau of the Member State that granted the residence permit or visa in order to allow the competent authority to determine whether there are sufficient reasons for withdrawing the residence permit/visa. The Member State which granted the residence permit or visa shall use an <span class="bold">O form</span> to inform the issuing Member State about the decision whether or not to withdraw the residence permit or visa. If this Member State decides to maintain the residence permit or visa, the alert shall be deleted.

      <p class="normal">If this person tries to enter the Member State that issued the residence permit or visa, he/she shall be allowed entry into the territory but the Sirene Bureau of that Member State, at the request of the competent authority, shall consult the Sirene Bureau of the issuing Member State in order to enable the competent authorities concerned to decide on withdrawal of the residence permit or visa or deletion of the alert. The Member State which granted the residence permit or visa shall use an <span class="bold">O form</span> to inform the issuing Member State about the decision whether or not to withdraw the residence permit or visa.

Equally it is possible for an object to have the same serial number as a very different object, for example, an issued document and a piece of industrial equipment. Where it is clear that the serial numbers are identical but the objects are clearly not the same no consultation between Sirene Bureaux is required. Users may be made aware that this situation can arise. Additionally, it is possible that an object, such as a passport or car, has been stolen and reported in one country and is subsequently reported in the country of origin. This could result in two alerts for the same object. If this matter comes to light it may be resolved by the Sirene Bureaux concerned.</p>

Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC lists the necessary conditions for acquiring right of residence for more than three months in a host Member State by family members of Union citizens who are third-country nationals. This list, which is exhaustive, does not allow for routine consultation of the SIS prior to the issuing of residence cards.

Article 27(2) stipulates: ‘Measures taken on grounds of public policy or public security shall comply with the principle of proportionality and shall be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned. Previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures. The personal conduct of the individual concerned must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. Justifications that are isolated from the particulars of the case or that rely on considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted.’ Moreover, there are additional limitations for persons enjoying the right of permanent residence who can only be refused entry or stay on serious grounds of public policy or public security as stated in Article 28(2) of Directive 2004/38/EC.</p>
