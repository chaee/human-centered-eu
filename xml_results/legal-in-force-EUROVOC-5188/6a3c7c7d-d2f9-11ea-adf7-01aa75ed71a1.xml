The Commission should propose, where appropriate, corresponding initiatives, including possible amendments to this Regulation and other relevant Union legal acts. With a view to improving the enforcement capabilities of competent authorities and minimising costs for both competent authorities and the economic operators, the Commission should also consider further measures such as enhanced interoperability of and a common access point to ICT systems and platforms used for recording and processing regulatory information as provided for in other Union transport law.</p>
