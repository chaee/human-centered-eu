      <p class="doc-ti">Updated version of the European Statement of Principles on human-machine interface (HMI) for in–vehicle information and communication systems</p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e41-3-1">1.   Definition and objectives</p>
      <p class="normal">This Statement of Principles summarises essential safety aspects to be considered for the human-machine interface (HMI) for in-vehicle information and communication systems. <span class="bold">This updated text version for 2006 replaces the previous one drawn up in 1999</span>.</p>
      <p class="normal">These principles promote the introduction of well designed systems into the market, and by taking into account both the potential benefits and associated risks they do not prevent innovation within the industry.</p>
      <p class="normal">These principles presume that those applying them have technical knowledge of the products as well as access to the resources needed to apply the principles in designing these systems. Considering that the driver’s primary task is to control the vehicle safely in a complex and dynamic traffic environment, <span class="bold">the primary goal of the principles is to fulfil this requirement</span>.</p>
      <p class="normal">These principles also take into account the capabilities and constraints of all stakeholders in their efforts to design, install and use in-vehicle information and communication systems. They are applicable to the development process, addressing issues like complexity, product costs and time to market, and in particular take into account small system manufacturers. Since the driver ultimately decides whether to buy and use, for example, an integrated navigation system, a nomadic device or a paper map, <span class="bold">the intention is to promote good HMI design rather than prohibit the inclusion of some functionalities by simplistic pass/fail criteria</span>.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="bold">The principles are not a substitute for any current regulations and standards, which should always be taken into consideration. These principles, which may be reinforced by national legislation or by individual companies, constitute the minimum set of requirements to be applied.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e69-3-1">2.   Scope</p>
      <p class="normal">These principles apply primarily to in-vehicle information and communication systems intended for use by the driver while the vehicle is in motion, for example navigation systems, mobile phones and traffic and travel information (TTI) systems. Due to a lack of comprehensive research results and scientific proof, they are not intended to apply to systems that are voice controlled or to systems providing vehicle braking stabilisation (such as ABS and ESP), or to system functionality providing information, warnings or support requiring immediate driver action (e.g. collision mitigation systems, night vision), sometimes referred to as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). ADAS are fundamentally different and require additional considerations in terms of human-machine interface. However, some of the principles may provide assistance in designing ADAS.</p>
      <p class="normal">The principles apply to all parts and aspects of all systems that are intended for interface with the driver while driving and also to certain other components. They also contain provisions for systems and their functionality that should not be used while driving. In these principles, ‘system’ refers to the functions and parts, such as displays and controls, which constitute the interface between the in-vehicle system and the driver. The scope of the principles excludes head-up displays and aspects not related to HMI, such as the electrical characteristics, material properties and legal aspects not related to safe use. Some principles make a distinction between system use ‘while driving’ (also called ‘while the vehicle is in motion’) and other use. Where no distinction is made, the principles refer only to system use by the driver while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">The principles apply specifically to vehicles of categories M and N<a id="ntc1-L_2008216EN.01000301-E0001" href="#ntr1-L_2008216EN.01000301-E0001"> (<span class="super">1</span>)</a>. They apply to both portable and permanently installed systems, and are intended to apply to systems and functionalities in OEM, after-market and nomadic systems. They apply to HMI functionality independently of the degree of integration between systems. In general, a number of industries and organisations are involved in designing, producing and providing parts of such systems and the associated services, including, for example:</p>

      <p class="normal">Where systems are provided by a vehicle manufacturer (OEM) it is clear that the manufacturer is responsible for the overall design. In other cases, the ‘product-responsible organisation’ will include the organisation introducing a product or functionality into the market, part or all of which may have been designed and produced by different parties. Consequently the responsibility may often be shared between different organisations. Where the term ‘manufacturer’ is used in the following text, it may cover several product-responsible organisations.</p>
      <p class="normal">Generally, it will be clear where the responsibility lies, among manufacturers, suppliers and installers, for applying the principles. Where the responsibility rests with more than one party, those parties are encouraged to use the principles as a starting point to explicitly confirm their respective roles.</p>
      <p class="normal">The responsibilities of the driver related to safe behaviour while driving and interacting with these systems remain unchanged.</p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e317-3-1">4.2.   General comments</p>
      <p class="normal">The need for special skills or training and the suitability of a system for different driver groups is a matter of definition by the manufacturers. Such definitions should be taken into account when considering the application of the principles to a system’s HMI.</p>
      <p class="normal">Where the manufacturer’s intention has been clearly stated (such that the driver can reasonably be expected to be aware of it) and the driver subsequently uses the system in a way which is not intended by the manufacturer, this can be considered as misuse.</p>
      <p class="normal">The current state of scientific development is not sufficient to make a compelling link between compliance criteria and safety for all the principles. For that reason, the principles are not linked systematically to standards or already defined and accepted criteria.</p>
      <p class="normal">Systems designed in accordance with the principles are generally expected to be safer than those that do not take account of them. However, it may be possible to meet the overall design goals even if one or more principles are violated.</p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e333-3-1">4.3.   Principles</p>
      <p class="normal">Each principle is elaborated under the following headings:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="bold">Explanation</span>: includes some rationale and further justification for the principle.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="bold">Examples</span>: ‘good’ and ‘bad’ examples provide additional explanation concerning implementation of the principle.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="bold">Application</span>: describes which specific systems or HMI functionality are being addressed by the principle as a necessary first step in determining whether a particular system’s HMI is in accordance with the principle.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="bold">Verification</span>: provides some information to address the question of whether a system complies with a principle. Where possible, a suitable method is outlined and interpretation of the resulting metric is given:</p>

         <span class="italic">The system supports the driver and does not give rise to potentially hazardous behaviour by the driver or other road users.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">An important overall requirement can be simply stated as ‘Do no harm’. This means that the system should enhance or at least not reduce road safety. The approach taken by this document is to systematically guide a system’s designer by way of principles addressing design-relevant aspects like installation, information presentation or interface. This is because the overall effects may not be entirely predictable or measurable since they depend not only on the system design but also on the individual driver and the driving task/traffic situation.</p>
      <p class="normal">Systems which are not designed with this principle in mind are unlikely to be in accordance with the other principles.</p>
      <p class="normal">4.3.1.2.   Design goal II</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">The allocation of driver attention while interacting with system displays and controls remains compatible with the attentional demand of the driving situation.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The driver has a limited but variable attentional resource and physical capacity which can be distributed dynamically by the driver between tasks. The resources activated by the driver not only depend on personal factors but may also vary according to his/her motivation and state. Interfaces (including visual, tactile and auditory) can induce both physical and cognitive workload.</p>
      <p class="normal">The relevant tasks addressed in this overall design goal are:</p>

      <p class="normal">Reaching this goal requires <span class="italic">compatibility</span> between the two tasks, whereby the attentional demand of the system does not cause the available resource to be less than that required to attend properly to the prevailing driving task. This means that the driver needs to be able to anticipate the attentional demand associated with both the driving task and secondary tasks.</p>
      <p class="normal">The concept of compatibility is preferable to a limit on the total amount of interface because:</p>
      <p class="normal">the concept of task is controversial since the same task can vary substantially in terms of its parameters, e.g. duration; moreover, a suitable definition of task is not available,</p>
      <p class="normal">depending on the motivation and state of the driver, an interface with displays and controls may have a different effect; this is due to the fact that less workload is not necessarily better,</p>
      <p class="normal">the relation between the components of interface (complexity, intensity, duration, etc.), workload and driving performance is not well enough understood.</p>
      <p class="normal">Systems which are designed in accordance with the ESoP should be such that the attentional demand of the system can be modified by the driver choosing to interact (or not), and by choosing when and how to interact. This also means that the driver can anticipate the attentional demand of the interface with the system.</p>

      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">The system does not distract or visually entertain the driver.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The aim of this principle is to ensure that the driver is distracted as little as possible by the use of a driver information or communication system while driving such that his/her ability to be in full control of the vehicle is not compromised. This design goal is also formulated to highlight the special importance of avoiding distraction caused by visual entertainment.</p>
      <p class="normal">Visual entertainment may occur by visually displaying images which are attractive (i.e. likely to catch the driver’s attention) because of their form or content. It is of particular relevance in the driving context because of the importance of vision for safe driving.</p>

      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">The system does not present information to the driver which results in potentially hazardous behaviour by the driver or other road users.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The content of the information should not encourage the driver to engage in behaviour which may increase the risk of an accident while driving. Hazardous behaviour may influence other road users’ behaviour. An example could be the display of a race-driving strategy in order to achieve maximum speed while cornering.</p>
      <p class="normal">Other road users may be concerned if the hazardous behaviour of the driver occurs when he/she is interacting with them, as well as if the system generates signals perceptible from the exterior which may induce erroneous interpretation by other road users, and possibly dangerous manoeuvres.</p>
      <p class="normal">4.3.1.5.   Design goal V</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Interfaces and interface with systems intended to be used in combination by the driver while the vehicle is in motion are consistent and compatible.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">All HMI components of individual systems should be designed in accordance with principles for single systems, which will give a minimum level of consistency. However, consistency can still be an issue between individual well-designed products.</p>
      <p class="normal">System use ‘in combination’ occurs when more than one system is used to achieve a desired result. This includes parallel use (i.e. use of more than one system at the same time) and serial use when the systems are used one after another. So, when designing a system for use in combination with another (possibly pre-existing system), account should be taken of the existing system. When the functionality is completely different, it may be good design to have a different HMI to avoid confusion.</p>
      <p class="normal">Consistency involves, for example, the following design issues:</p>

         <span class="italic">No part of the system should obstruct the driver’s view of the road scene.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Successful performance of the driving task is mainly based on the acquisition of visual information about the local road and traffic environment. Consequently, construction regulations ensure that each road vehicle provides the driver with an adequate external field of view out of the vehicle from the driver’s seat. Additional systems must not compromise this basic design provision. This principle is likely to be particularly important for the installation of after-market and nomadic systems.</p>
      <p class="normal">The ‘driver’s view’ is the mandatory minimum requirement in accordance with EU regulations. It should be interpreted as pertaining to the forward view directly through the windscreen, and to side views and rear view either directly or indirectly.</p>
      <p class="normal">If the physical position of a component of the system can be modified by the driver and can (as part of its intended range of movement) obstruct the driver’s vision, then the driver should be informed, through the system instructions (see section 6) about the use as intended by the manufacturer. If no such information is provided to the driver, then the principle should apply throughout the range of adjustment of the system or its component.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: A display mounted within the instrument panel in such a way that it can be easily viewed by the driver but does not interfere with the field-of-view requirements.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: A display mounted on a long flexible stalk from the upper surface of the instrument panel which can be adjusted in such a way that the display obscures a substantial part of the external road scene.</p>

      <p class="normal">The principle applies to all in-vehicle systems, and is a very important consideration for after-market systems and nomadic devices. It does not apply to head-up displays.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The aim of this principle is to ensure that the driver’s ability to use mandatory displays and controls and other displays and controls required for the primary driving task is not compromised by the physical presence of a system (such as a display). This ensures that the driver’s ability to be in full control of the vehicle is not affected by installation of the system.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Obstruction of controls</span> in this context means to prevent operation of the relevant controls throughout their intended range of movement, or to make it significantly more difficult to identify, reach and/or operate them.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Obstruction of displays</span> in this context means to render not visible some portion (any portion) of the relevant displays from the driver’s normal seating position.</p>
      <p class="normal">The required controls and displays are those needed to undertake the primary driving task and all those which are mandatory.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Required controls include</span>: accelerator, brake (clutch, if fitted), steering wheel, gear changer, parking brake, horn, light switches, turn indicators, washers and wipers (all modes and speeds), hazard flashers, de-mister controls.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Required displays include</span>: the speedometer, all warning lights, mandatory control labels and mandatory tell-tales.</p>
      <p class="normal">Obstruction or impairment of other controls and displays should be balanced against the additional benefits provided by the system.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: A route-guidance display integrated into the dashboard in a high central position which does not obstruct any other displays or controls.</p>
      <p class="normal">

      <p class="normal">An after-market route guidance system which obstructs the light switches,</p>

      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The principle applies to all in-vehicle systems, and is a very important consideration for after-market systems and nomadic devices.</p>

         <span class="italic">Visual displays should be positioned as close as practicable to the driver’s normal line of sight.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">For a driver to be in full control of the vehicle and aware of the dynamic road scene there is a broad consensus that, apart from brief glances at mirrors or instrumentation, the driver’s gaze should be directed towards the road scene. Visual displays positioned close to the normal line of sight reduce the total eyes-off-the-road time relative to those which are positioned further away, thus maximising the possibility for a driver to use peripheral vision to monitor the road scene for major developments while looking at a display. The further away from the driver’s normal line of sight the display is positioned, the more difficult it is to obtain information and the greater the possible impact on driving performance.</p>
      <p class="normal">It is recommended that the most important or safety-critical information be closest to the normal line of sight.</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle therefore requires the designer/installer to make an explicit, but essentially qualitative, trade-off between practicability and closeness. Important factors include:</p>

         <span class="italic">Visual displays should be designed and installed to avoid glare and reflections.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Glare and reflections that are likely to make it more difficult to extract information from the display may cause distraction from the driving task or other tasks performed while driving. This is likely to lead to increased driver frustration and annoyance and may evoke behavioural adaptations such as squinting, closing of the eyes for brief periods and head movements to obtain a more comfortable view. All of these effects are likely to reduce driver comfort and, therefore, may compromise road safety to some extent.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Glare</span> is the distracting (and potentially disabling) effect of bright light in an otherwise relatively dark scene which interferes with visual attention and selection. In the in-vehicle context, this can occur in a number of ways:</p>
      <p class="normal">external light (usually sunlight) falling on the visual display reduces display contrast and makes the information on the screen more difficult to see from the driver’s normal viewing position,</p>
      <p class="normal">the display is itself too bright and causes distraction from the road scene and other in-vehicle displays and controls. This is most likely to be apparent to the driver in low ambient light conditions.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Reflection</span> is the generation of a secondary image of an object as a result of light from the object bouncing off intermediate surfaces. This is relevant in a number of ways:</p>
      <p class="normal">light from a light-emitting display travels to another surface (or via several surfaces), producing a secondary image of the display screen, for example on the windscreen. This is most likely to be perceived by the driver when there is high contrast between the secondary image and its background, such as against the windscreen during darkness,</p>
      <p class="normal">light from an external source (e.g. the sun, streetlights, or other bright objects) is reflected by the display surface into the driver’s eyes (see also glare above).</p>
      <p class="normal">The effects should be considered during the design and installation process. Issues that could be considered include provision of a (manual or automatic) display brightness control, choice of display technology, choice of display surface texture and finish, choice of colour and gloss of surfaces being reflected in the display surface, choice of image polarity, siting of the display and adjustability, the use of a recess or cowl.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: A screen with an automatic brightness control which does not produce secondary images on the vehicle’s glass and which has a display front surface that can be easily read under all normal lighting conditions.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: A display which is so bright at night that it is significant in the driver’s peripheral vision when looking at the forward road-scene and whose information is difficult to read in sunlight because the contrast is so low.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The principle applies to all in-vehicle information and communication systems equipped with visual displays.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">The verification should be based upon procedures to determine glare and reflections. Specific criteria depend on the vehicle concept.</p>

         <span class="italic">Visually displayed information presented at any one time by the system should be designed in such a way that the driver is able to assimilate the relevant information with a few glances which are brief enough not to adversely affect driving.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Visual processing by the driver to take account of the traffic environment forms the basis for completion of vehicle control and manoeuvring tasks. Therefore, activity necessary for detecting and acquiring visually presented relevant information at any one time should be limited. Increasing the frequency and/or duration of glances required to detect and acquire visually displayed information may increase the risk of potentially dangerous traffic situations caused by driver preoccupation with non-primary driving-related tasks. Relevant information is the portion of all visually displayed information sought by the driver to satisfy a particular need.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: Easily legible and well-structured graphics on a well-positioned visual display which allows identification of the relevant menu item with a single one-second glance.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: A navigation system which only offers support by a visual display rich in detail, which needs full and lengthy attention of the driver to identify a target on a moving map.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The principle applies to all in-vehicle information and communication systems with visual displays presenting information intended to be viewed by the driver while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">Compare design alternatives for the presentation of information: the number and duration of glances needed to detect and acquire relevant information presented at any one time should be minimised.</p>

         <span class="italic">Information relevant to the driving task should be accurate and provided in a timely manner.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Information relevant to the driving task should be provided to the driver at the most appropriate moment and be sufficiently accurate to assist the driver in dealing adequately with the situation.</p>
      <p class="normal">The driving task requires the driver to continuously monitor the environment to select relevant stimuli and to concentrate and focus attention on those stimuli which require adjustment of his/her behaviour. Such adjustment depends on which action is most suitable for the situation and on the goals and priorities of the driver. The actions may involve changing speed, changing lane, warning others, etc.</p>
      <p class="normal">Correctly timed and accurate information reduces uncertainty by giving valid and clear answers to questions such as: ‘What?’‘When?’‘Where?’‘For how long?’ etc. The requirement of accuracy and timing of information also implies that it is necessary for the displayed message to match the driver’s judgement of the environment. Therefore, information should not conflict with, for instance, road signs. Systems providing ill-timed and/or incorrect information may create safety-critical driver distraction and frustration.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: The distance to the next manoeuvre is provided exactly at the point where the driver needs to know if a manoeuvre is to be undertaken and which manoeuvre it should be.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: Direction instructions from a navigation system are displayed well after the manoeuvre needs to be performed.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The principle applies to all auditory and visual time-critical information provided by information and communication systems.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification by checking whether the information provided by the system is sufficiently correct and presented at the expected time.</p>

         <span class="italic">Information with higher safety relevance should be given higher priority.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The driver may need to perceive and act on safety-relevant information within a short timescale. Such information therefore needs to be presented as rapidly as possible and should not be delayed by more routine information.</p>
      <p class="normal">Information priority from the point of view of safety-relevance depends on its urgency and criticality (i.e. severity of the consequences if the information is not acted upon). These factors, in turn, also depend on the driving situation as explained in ISO/TS 16951. Where information is generated off-board (from the roadside or a remote system), prioritisation cannot take account of the driving situation and only a more generic priority allocation is possible. Where information is derived from autonomous vehicle systems, or where external and on-board information can be combined, the possibility of appreciating the driving situation exists and message priority can be refined.</p>
      <p class="normal">For off-board information, the dynamic information providers (service providers) should implement an information dissemination strategy which, besides being current and reliable, ensures that transmission priority is given to messages with the highest importance. In-vehicle systems need to recognise incoming safety-relevant messages and treat them accordingly.</p>
      <p class="normal">Safety relevance of information may not always be easily determined and not all information may be technically available for prioritisation.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: Information concerning manoeuvring around a complex intersection is given priority over an incoming telephone call.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: A high-priority message concerning ice at the current location is prevented from being delivered immediately because the information screen is in the process of displaying a message concerning distant traffic congestion.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The principle applies to systems that provide dynamic information (i.e. information that changes as a result of conditions immediately surrounding the vehicle or traffic conditions more generally).</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification by checking whether priority of information is taken into account.</p>

      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">The driver should always be able to keep at least one hand on the steering wheel while interacting with the system.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle is concerned with interfaces which require the driver to provide manual control inputs (e.g. using buttons or knobs).</p>
      <p class="normal">There are driving situations which require the driver to have precise control of the vehicle’s steering and this can be achieved most effectively with both hands on the steering wheel. For other driving situations, one hand on the steering wheel is acceptable as long as the other hand is immediately available for steering if circumstances demand it. That leads to the consideration that handheld devices are not recommended for use whilst driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">To be in accord with this principle, the system should be designed in such a way that only one hand needs to be away from the steering wheel to interact with the system, leaving one hand remaining on the steering wheel. In addition, if one hand must be removed from the steering wheel to undertake the interface, the other hand should not simultaneously be needed for interface (e.g. for operating fingertip controls).</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: A control device that is securely mounted in a conveniently positioned holder and can be used one-handed without removal from the holder.</p>

         <span class="italic">The system should not require long and uninterruptible sequences of manual-visual interface. If the sequence is short, it may be uninterruptible.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The principle allows for uninterruptible sequences of interface as long as they are short, whereas a long interface sequence should be interruptible by the driver. This means that the system should not delete any driver input during interruption unless the interface sequence is short or a sufficiently large time-out period has passed.</p>
      <p class="normal">If a driver is aware that a sequence of interfaces is ‘interruptible’, there will be a greater tendency to attend to developing traffic situations in the knowledge that the system interface can be completed when the traffic situation has been attended to.</p>
      <p class="normal">On the other hand, an interface may be uninterruptible if it is short in order to avoid an additional input for returning the system’s state to normal. A well established example is a two- or three-step interface for changing the sound settings of a conventional radio.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: An interface sequence for looking up traffic information can be interrupted without the system changing its state.</p>
      <p class="normal">Only a few of the ‘short-sequence-interfaces’, three button presses or fewer, have a 10-second time-out period.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: Key presses when entering a telephone number must not be more than five seconds apart or all previously entered numbers are cancelled.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The principle applies to systems with manual-visual sequences of interface, i.e. the function requires more than one input (by inspection). It does not apply to speech-based systems.</p>

      <p class="normal">If partly entered data disappears when an input sequence is interrupted, the driver may be tempted to go through the full sequence even if the driving situation requires full attention.</p>

      <p class="normal">When the driver resumes the sequence, it may happen that some events have made the point of interruption no longer relevant. In such cases, the logical point provided by the system will simplify the task and lessen the workload.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: The driver can interrupt entering a phone number, look for several seconds at the road scene and then complete the partly entered number.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: When the driver is reading a list of traffic messages and interrupts viewing halfway through the list, the system cancels the list after a short time-out period. Consequently the driver needs to ‘call’ the list again in order to resume reading.</p>

         <span class="italic">The driver should be able to control the pace of interface with the system. In particular the system should not require the driver to make time-critical responses when providing inputs to the system.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Interface with the system refers here to making input by a control action, or by voice, into the system, either at the driver’s initiative or as a response to displayed information initiated by the system itself. The provision of an appropriate response usually requires the driver to perceive and process information before deciding on the correct action. This presupposes that the situation develops in such a way that the driver has sufficient time and mental resources available. As there are currently no systems which can predict the level of driver workload in a continuous and reliable manner, for the sake of safety and convenience it should be for the driver alone to decide when he/she is ready to respond to the system.</p>
      <p class="normal">Time-critical responses are responses which must be made by the driver within a short imposed time window. The driver is able to control the pace if he/she always remains in command of the time before which an input must be provided and the time for which the output is displayed.</p>
      <p class="normal">Exceptions:</p>
      <p class="normal">if the information displayed is directly related to the immediate driving situation (e.g. the precise speed of the vehicle, the distance to the next turn — which determines the time for which a displayed route direction is valid, etc.),</p>
      <p class="normal">if the system provides assistance to help the driver to escape from hazards or avoid mistakes and requires the driver to react within a specific time,</p>
      <p class="normal">the second click on an input device which requires a double click as a specific signal is acceptable,</p>
      <p class="normal">inputs provided by the same control giving different results depending on the duration of the control activation (e.g. a button kept pressed for several seconds for radio station storage) are not within the scope of this principle.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: The driver can choose to listen to incoming touristic messages when the situation permits and messages are not automatically presented to the driver when they arrive.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: Confirmation or rejection of a navigation system’s re-routing proposal due to traffic problems is available only for a few seconds before re-routing automatically starts.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">Systems which provide information not directly related to the immediate driving situation (compare exceptions under explanation).</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>

      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle addresses the relationship between the primary driving controls and the system controls in order to avoid unintended interference of operation. This means that the location, kinematics, control forces and control travel of a system control should allow it to be operated in a way that neither hinders an intended primary control input nor facilitates an unintended primary control input.</p>

         <span class="italic">The driver should have control of the loudness of auditory information where there is likelihood of distraction.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">To have control of auditory information means that the driver can adjust the volume and mute the sound to a virtually imperceptible level.</p>
      <p class="normal">Distraction is the capture of significant driver attention by stimuli which can arise from non-driving-relevant information, or from driving-relevant information presented in such a way that the stimulus attracts more driver attention than needed. This undesirable capture of driver attention may be caused by the frequency of the stimulus, its duration or its intensity and, more generally, by its irrelevance to the driving task, and may subsequently cause irritation.</p>
      <p class="normal">Since some important information may have to be conveyed to the driver while the sound is off or while the sound level has been turned down to an inaudible level, non-auditory information on the system’s state may be provided.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: The driver may control the ‘incoming phone call’ acoustic signal and select a mode where only a visual signal is displayed.</p>
      <p class="normal">

      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>

      <p class="normal">The system’s response is timely if it is perceived as quite instantaneous. For control activation feedback, timing should be from the moment at which the system recognises each driver input. For the dialogue level response (which may be either the requested information or an indication that processing is underway), the timing should be from the end of the driver’s input.</p>
      <p class="normal">When the system needs significant processing time, some signal should be displayed to inform the driver that the system has recognised the input and is preparing the requested response.</p>
      <p class="normal">The system’s response is clearly perceptible if it is obvious to the driver that a change has occurred in the system and that this change results from the input.</p>
      <p class="normal">A system which reacts as expected by the driver contributes to the reliability of the driver-system interface. Any delayed, ambiguous or uncertain system response may be misinterpreted or taken as an error by the system or by the driver, and may lead to the driver making a second input.</p>
      <p class="normal">Uncertainty about whether input has been completed also reduces driver attention to the road scene.</p>

      <p class="normal">

      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: The last RDS message displayed on driver request differs from the previous one by only one item: the number of km. This item is not enhanced, which creates doubt about whether the input has been acknowledged by the system or not.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">All information and communication systems with manual input.</p>
      <p class="normal">Systems controlled by voice are not currently considered as within the scope of this principle because the nature and structure of speech is such that mid-sentence pauses can be significant.

      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>

         <span class="italic">While the vehicle is in motion, visual information not related to driving that is likely to distract the driver significantly should be automatically disabled, or presented in such a way that the driver cannot see it.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle emphasises the importance of the visual modality for safe driving and seeks to limit visual information from within the vehicle which can provide a distraction from the primary driving task. Likelihood of significant distraction refers to modes of presentation where the information has a dynamic and unpredictable component such that the entirety of information presented cannot be obtained by the driver with a few brief glances (e.g. TV, video and automatically scrolling images and text).</p>
      <p class="normal">One example is automatically scrolling images and text that cover a variety of forms of dynamic presentation where the driver is not able to pace the presentation and where the entire information is not available at any one time. Other specific modes of presentation, e.g. ‘Internet pages’, should be examined within the context of these examples. Scrolling lists under the control of the driver, such as navigation system destinations, are not within the scope of this principle as the driver can always interrupt and resume the interface.</p>
      <p class="normal">Even after a vehicle comes to a halt, it is recommended that a time delay of a few seconds be included before one of the visual presentation modes covered by this principle is activated. This deals, at least partially, with the situation of divided attention of the driver in ‘stop-and-go’ traffic conditions.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: A TV picture which goes blank when the vehicle is in motion and does not reappear immediately when the vehicle stops.</p>
      <p class="normal">

      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle refers only to visual information which is not related to driving. Therefore it does not apply to non-visual information, like tonal or verbal information, or to visual information related to driving.</p>

      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle is intended to ensure that the driver’s ability to be in full control of the vehicle is not affected (in a way which compromises safety) by the behaviour of the information and communication system during normal operation or failure. This means that the system should not override information or controls necessary for the safe operation of the vehicle. In this context, interference is any influence or interface which modifies the performance, characteristics or behaviour of existing displays or controls.</p>
      <p class="normal">Adverse interference with displays or controls results in overall impairment of performance (from that intended) of the display or control. Examples include changes to mandatory displays or controls. In addition, the behaviour of a system should not obstruct or render inoperative other systems which are specifically intended as safety systems.</p>

         <span class="italic">System functions not intended to be used by the driver while driving should be made impossible to interact with while the vehicle is in motion, or, as a less preferred option, clear warnings should be provided against the unintended use.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle seeks to ensure clarity, particularly for the driver, in terms of the manufacturer’s intention for use of the system. If this principle is complied with, subsequent use of the system outside the scope of intended use can be considered as misuse.</p>
      <p class="normal">‘Impossible’ in this context means that the designated system function is not operable by the driver during normal use or during reasonably foreseeable misuse. In this context, it would not be reasonable for a manufacturer to anticipate that a driver would undertake sophisticated technical measures to defeat the manufacturer’s intentions. The manufacturer’s rationale may be based on regulation or their own judgement.</p>
      <p class="normal">A clear warning gives information or advice about the negative consequences of a situation or action in sufficient detail. The warning is available in such a way or form that the driver can readily perceive it. It can be written information or an automatic display by the system. Reasonable drivers should be in no doubt concerning the use of the system intended by the manufacturer after taking account of the clear warning.</p>
      <p class="normal">There are a number of ways of conveying warnings. A continuously displayed warning is one option. If the warning is not continuously displayed, then it should remain available for a sufficient duration to ensure that the driver has the opportunity to become aware of it. One suitable solution is for the driver to acknowledge the warning by pressing a button.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: When the vehicle starts to move, the driver’s interface with an Internet website is cancelled and a message ‘not available while driving’ is displayed. When the vehicle comes to a full stop, the driver can resume the interface.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: A television facility is designated as an unavailable function while the vehicle is in motion as detected by a handbrake position sensor. The sensor on the handbrake can be deactivated by a partially engaged handbrake. (This is an example of misuse which is reasonably foreseeable and should, therefore, have been designed out, or clear warnings provided.)</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle applies only to system functions intended by the manufacturer not to be used by the driver while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>

      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">There can be safety implications when there is a divergence between the actual function of a system and the driver’s reasonable expectations based on previous information and/or experience. Therefore a change in status or a malfunction which modifies system performance needs to be made apparent to the driver.</p>
      <p class="normal">The information to be presented should be designed to be readily perceived by the driver (i.e. easily understood and meaningful) in terms of the consequences of the current status or system malfunction, particularly on vehicle control and manoeuvring with respect to other traffic and the road infrastructure.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: An in-vehicle speed advice system informs the driver that the system is unable to provide dynamic information rather than continuing to show the prevailing inter-urban speed even on entry to an urban area.</p>

      <p class="normal">4.3.6.1.   Information about the system principle I</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">The system should have adequate instructions for the driver covering use and relevant aspects of installation and maintenance.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle aims to ensure that instructions are available to as many drivers as possible so that they can easily become aware of the capabilities and limitations of the system, its context of use, proper installation and maintenance. Drivers should rarely need to seek information beyond that provided in the instructions.</p>
      <p class="normal">Adequate instructions are sufficient for the driver’s purpose under circumstances that the manufacturer may reasonably anticipate. This will depend on the intended use of the system (functionality, context, etc.). One indication of adequacy is the size and quality of any text or diagrams. For example, print is not expected to be smudged or in a font style which is too small or difficult to read. For written instructions, ‘adequate’ relates to the physical media of presentation. For example, printed material should be on paper (or other material) providing reasonable durability and the printing should be permanent on that material. Instructions which are only on packaging material are not considered adequate as packaging is likely to be discarded rather than being passed to subsequent owners. If instructions are only available in the form of ‘help functions’, these should be designed in a way that allows their operation without prior reading of written material.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: Good quality printed colour manual on A5 pages with text and illustrations which fits within the glove box.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: No instructions; sketchy instructions just on the packaging material; instructions on poor quality paper; instructions that are so small that they can be easily mislaid.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle applies to system instructions in all forms.</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle refers to system instructions intended for the driver, not a full workshop manual as might be required by garages or maintenance institutions.</p>
      <p class="normal">The principle applies to all aspects of systems which, as may be reasonably anticipated by the manufacturer, drivers will require at some time within the expected life of the system. The principle excludes aspects of systems specifically designated by the manufacturer as not intended for use while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification requires assessment and judgement specifically taking into account the system’s functionality and the intended user groups.</p>
      <p class="normal">4.3.6.2.   Information about the system principle II</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">System instructions should be correct and simple.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Design of user instructions is an HMI issue in itself. Instructions are typically ignored by drivers and this is exacerbated by poor design of the instructions. This principle is intended to promote high acceptance of instructions by drivers.</p>
      <p class="normal">Instructions should be factually accurate in all important aspects. Each element of the instructions (group of words, diagram, function-described, etc.) should be correct for the actual system to which it relates.</p>
      <p class="normal">Simple has to be interpreted in the context of the system being described and will vary with the complexity and functionality of the system. The instructions should be unambiguous and easy to understand, if possible by all members of the intended user population (e.g. documents in ‘plain language’). Instructions should not be overly technical and should use user-oriented language. It is important that the instructions are simple even if the system is complex.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: Good examples might be expected to have some of the following features: well presented manual with factually accurate text and diagrams, contents page, page numbers, good use of colour, written in a plain language style using common words. Good index. Use of different fonts, italics, bold, underline, etc. to distinguish portions of the text.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: Instructions which refer to a previous model with different functions and controls.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle applies to system instructions in all forms.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">Assessment of correctness is a matter of comparison between the actual system and the system instructions. Assessment of simplicity is a matter of judgement taking driver knowledge and expectations into account.</p>
      <p class="normal">A system instruction can conform with this principle even if small errors are present, as long as these can be shown to be unimportant and are not too numerous.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification requires assessment and judgement.</p>
      <p class="normal">4.3.6.3.   Information about the system principle III</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">System instructions should be in languages or forms designed to be understood by the intended group of drivers.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The aim of this principle is to ensure that instructions are of use to as many drivers as possible and that drivers are aware of the capabilities and limitations of the system, its context of use, etc.</p>
      <p class="normal">Different <span class="italic">forms</span> of instructions may exist which could be presented in different modalities. Auditory instructions may be spoken or presented by means of noises or earcons. Visually presented information includes diagrams, photographs, highlighting of the next element, programmed tutorials, etc.</p>
      <p class="normal">Spoken instructions and written instructions (either printed or within a system) will be in one or a number of <span class="italic">languages</span> (e.g. English, Finnish, etc.)</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle requires that when instructions are being devised, consideration is given to the intended and most likely driver population, and those instructions can reasonably be expected to be understood and used by as many drivers as possible.</p>
      <p class="normal">Manufacturers should consider the driver population and the likely and intended use of the system as well as the native languages and other languages spoken and read. Published statistics on language proficiency by country could be used as a reference. At the very least, the majority language of the country in which the system is sold should be considered necessary. Diagrams often provide additional clarity. Where used, these should follow accepted stereotypes and conventions for the intended population.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: For a system sold in Sweden, instructions are formulated in easily understandable Swedish and incorporate pictorial help at relevant passages.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: Written instructions (without diagrams or photographs) automatically translated from Japanese (unedited) for a system presented for sale on the European market.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle applies to instructions in all forms.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification requires assessment and judgement taking into account the system’s functionality and the intended user groups.</p>
      <p class="normal">4.3.6.4.   Information about the system principle IV</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">The instructions should clearly state which functions of the system are intended to be used by the driver while driving and those which are not.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Instructions that accord with this principle allow the driver the opportunity to be fully aware of the use of the system intended by the manufacturer and make clear the responsibilities in cases where the driver uses the system beyond the manufacturer’s intentions. Functions which are specifically not intended by the manufacturer to be used by the driver while driving should be explicitly designated as such whether disabled while the vehicle is in motion or not.</p>
      <p class="normal">After becoming aware of the instructions, reasonable drivers should be in no doubt about which functions of the system have been designed to be used by the driver while driving (i.e. the intended use of the system). They should also be in no doubt about those functions which have not been designed for use while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">A specific recommendation is that if drivers need to equip themselves before using a hands-free communication system, they should be instructed to do so while the vehicle is not in motion.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: Instructions for a mobile phone which state that the handset is not intended for use in a moving vehicle (and the handset is disabled and switches to hands-free microphone/speaker when the vehicle is in motion).</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: A feature-rich driver information and communication system which has additional functionality for use by a passenger, or driver while stationary, but whose instructions make no clear distinction concerning the features intended for use by the driver while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle applies to instructions in all forms.</p>

      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Product information should be designed to accurately convey the system functionality.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The aim of this principle is to encourage good design of all product information and to assist potential or current users of the system in appreciating the benefits and limitations of the system.</p>
      <p class="normal">All product information should be factually correct and presented transparently and without ambiguity. Information does not have to be comprehensive to be accurate.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Functionality</span> is concerned with what the system does and, by implication, the benefits that the functionality provides to the driver. Functionality should distinguish between that which is designed to be used by the driver while driving and that which is not, i.e. the information should not claim or imply that a function which has not been designed to be used while driving can be so used. The product information should make it clear if additional software or hardware is required (other than that supplied with the base model) for specific functionality.</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle is also in line with consumer protection requirements, EU regulations and existing codes concerning advertising, and all product information should conform to the report on advertising.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: A communications system which is not designed to store telephone numbers while driving provides the information that ‘pre-stored numbers can be selected using a single button’.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: The same communications system provides the information ‘telephone numbers can be stored for later use’ adjacent to a picture of a driver and vehicle in motion. This association implies that number storage is designed for use while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle refers to product information intended for the driver, not a full workshop manual as might be required by garages or maintenance institutions.</p>

      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Product information should make it clear if special skills are required to use the system as intended by the manufacturer or if the product is unsuitable for particular users.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle seeks to ensure that the manufacturer’s intention as regards target group is made clear to potential and actual users of the system. The normal presumption is that a system can be used by all drivers. However, initial training may be required; for example, for systems designed for specialist professional use. Although all drivers are required to have a minimum level of (far) vision, other capabilities may vary considerably and this includes the capabilities of drivers with special needs.</p>
      <p class="normal">This principle is also designed to encourage compliance with consumer protection requirements, EU regulations and existing codes concerning advertising.</p>
      <p class="normal">Product information refers to any information that the driver has access to concerning the system. It includes system instructions, technical specifications, promotional materials, packaging, etc. However, full workshop and technical manuals are excluded from the scope of this principle.</p>
      <p class="normal">The need for special skills and the unsuitability for particular user groups are matters for definition by the manufacturers. If any special skill requirement or initial training is envisaged by a manufacturer, then all product information should make this clear. Similarly, any restriction on use intended by the manufacturer should be described in the product information.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: The product information makes it clear that routing instructions are provided exclusively using the auditory modality and the system is therefore unsuitable for drivers with a hearing impairment.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: A voice input system only works reliably with deep male voices, but this limitation is not made clear in the product information.</p>

         <span class="italic">Representations of system use (e.g. descriptions, photographs and sketches) should neither create unrealistic expectations on the part of potential users nor encourage unsafe use.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The aim of this principle is to assist the driver in appreciating the functionality, benefits and limitations of the system before (and during) use. It is also intended to promote road safety and compliance with existing traffic regulations and codes of road and vehicle use as well as consumer protection requirements, EU regulations and existing codes concerning advertising.</p>
      <p class="normal">Unrealistic expectations are expectations held by reasonable potential users (based on their own knowledge and experience and any product information available) which are false, partial, too high or overly general.</p>
      <p class="normal">Unsafe use covers various types of behaviour, including any behaviour which is in conflict with the road code of the EU Member States where the system is used.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: Photographs of the system being used as intended by the manufacturer and in accordance with all relevant codes and regulations.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: A photograph showing a hand-held telephone being used while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">This applies to all representations of system use including those provided by the manufacturer in instruction manuals (diagrams, etc.), photographs, films, computer animations, sound clips and any form of product information or advertising that users or potential users of the system may be exposed to.</p>

         <span class="italic">Employers should ensure that all in-vehicle information systems are maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">It is expected that the product-responsible organisation will, in accordance with ESoP principle 4.3.6.1, produce instructions on how the information systems should be maintained (physical issues, hardware, replaceable parts, software and software updates, etc.)</p>
      <p class="normal">The employer should ensure (by direct action, contract or instruction) that all recommended maintenance actions are carried out. This is to help ensure that the product supports the driver as much as possible.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: The route guidance system’s map CD is updated regularly (e.g. annually) as recommended by the manufacturer.</p>
      <p class="normal">

      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The recommendation applies to in-vehicle information and communication systems that, based on the product-responsible organisation’s recommendations, require maintenance.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">The employer should maintain a permanent record of maintenance actions. These records should be in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
      <p class="normal">5.2.1.2.   Recommendation on influencing use II</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Employers’ procedures and incentive schemes should not cause or encourage system misuse. There should be a clear distinction between systems or functions that are intended (by the employer) to be used while driving and those that are not.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Employers are expected to have procedures concerning the conduct of their employees. Those related to use of in-vehicle information and communication systems should support safe driving practice. Therefore, the procedures should discourage listening to, or reading, complex information while driving. They should not put employees in a position where they are required to make difficult business decisions ‘live’ on the phone.</p>
      <p class="normal">Similarly, company reward (incentive) or punishment schemes should not encourage system misuse by implicitly condoning time saving by inappropriate use of systems while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">For each system, the employer should make it clear, by specific written instructions and procedures, whether a system (or functions of a system) may be used while driving or whether it is not permitted. This removes the situation where individual drivers make personal (and often not well-founded) decisions concerning system use.</p>
      <p class="normal">Where multiple (non-integrated) systems are available to drivers, restrictions on use of multiple systems should be documented (e.g. do not use system A simultaneously with system B while driving).</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: Company policy forbids all mobile phone use while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: The company reward scheme is related to the number of deliveries completed in a fixed time period and this encourages use while driving of a system not designed for such use.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The recommendation applies where there is an employer-employee relationship, where driving is part of the task, and where the information systems are supplied by the employer.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">Clear permanent instructions are provided to the drivers, listing the systems or functions of a system that should not be used while driving;</p>
      <p class="normal">The employer periodically checks the employee’s knowledge and understanding of company procedures and which functions or systems should not be used while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">5.2.1.3.   Recommendation on influencing use III</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Adequate training should be given on all in-vehicle systems that employers require drivers to use while driving. Employers should ensure that employees can use the systems without endangering themselves or other road users.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">The recommendation requires employers to identify which information systems their drivers need to use and to provide training such that recommendations for safe use are fully explained to them. It also requires some assessment of whether, in practice, each employee can undertake the dual task of system use and safe driving at the same time.</p>
      <p class="normal">The need for this recommendation arises from the different physical and cognitive abilities of drivers and the need to assess, on an individual basis, that they are capable of undertaking the required job. The job in this case involves driving and simultaneous use of an information or communication system. The rationale is that training improves performance and safety.</p>
      <p class="normal">Where multiple (non-integrated) systems are involved, training and documentation should describe how tasks can be achieved using multiple systems; training on individual systems is not a complete solution.</p>
      <p class="normal">Note that the driver will always be expected to attend to safe driving as the primary task (as required by the 1968 Vienna Convention) and may, therefore, abandon or suspend use of an in-vehicle information or communication system as external circumstances dictate.</p>
      <p class="normal">Relevant EU legislation exists:</p>
      <p class="normal">Council Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85<a id="ntc11-L_2008216EN.01000301-E0011" href="#ntr11-L_2008216EN.01000301-E0011"> (<span class="super">11</span>)</a> (harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport) — last amended on 15 July 2003 by the European Parliament and the Council (Directive 2003/59/EC on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers).</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: The employer has an ongoing monitoring and assessment programme that includes expert assessor observation of driving performance whilst simultaneously using the information system. It also solicits feedback from drivers.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: The employer states that a system may (or should) be used while driving, but does not monitor in any way the impact that this has on driving performance and safety.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The recommendation applies where there is an employer-employee relationship and where driving is part of the task and where the information systems supplied by the employer need to be used while driving, or may be used while driving according to the employer’s procedures.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">Employers identify systems that their drivers are required to use as part of their job,</p>
      <p class="normal">drivers are trained on system use,</p>
      <p class="normal">the employer periodically checks the employee’s knowledge and understanding of the system’s operation and functionality,</p>
      <p class="normal">the employer periodically checks that the employee can use the system safely while driving.</p>
      <p class="normal">5.2.1.4.   Recommendation on influencing use IV</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Employers should ensure that a copy of the manufacturer’s instructions for use is available in every equipped vehicle.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Since some information and communication systems are rich in features and some of the functions are rarely used, there are often situations when a driver needs to refer to some instructions in order to undertake a task. Without instructions, the driver may be more frustrated or distracted by the system or may be unable to complete the task.</p>
      <p class="normal">The recommendation requires employers to ensure that user instructions are available and that a copy is provided in each vehicle used by their employees.</p>
      <p class="normal">Where multiple (non-integrated) systems are involved, training and documentation should describe how tasks can be achieved using multiple systems; one instruction manual per system is not a complete solution.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: The telephone manufacturer provides user instructions and the employer places a copy in each vehicle and periodically checks that it is present.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: No user manual is provided or no system is in place to ensure that a copy remains in each equipped vehicle.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The recommendation applies where there is an employer-employee relationship and where driving is part of the task and where the information systems are supplied by the employer.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">The test is presence within each relevant vehicle of the correct user instructions.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification by inspection.</p>

      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Point-of-sale promotion (e.g. advertising) should not encourage unsafe use.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">This recommendation is intended to assist the driver in appreciating the functionality, benefits and limitations of the system before (and during) use and to promote road safety. It is also designed to encourage compliance with consumer protection requirements, EU regulations and existing codes concerning advertising.</p>
      <p class="normal">Promotional materials include those provided by the point of sale in instructions (diagrams etc.), photographs, films, computer animations, sound clips and any form of product information or advertising that users or potential users of the system may be exposed to.</p>
      <p class="normal">Unsafe use means anything which is in conflict with these recommendations or with safe driving codes.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: Photographs of the system being used as intended by the manufacturer and in accordance with all relevant codes and regulations.</p>
      <p class="normal">

      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The recommendation applies to any product-related information provided by the point of sale for all in-vehicle information and communication systems.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>
      <p class="normal">The test is compliance with the advertising code of practice.</p>

      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Point-of-sale information should inform vehicle purchasers of the safety issues associated with in-vehicle information systems.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Explanation:</p>
      <p class="normal">Drivers are influenced in their use of in-vehicle information and communication systems according to their knowledge about the system and their appreciation of the risks of use. In order to promote risk-aware driving, and hence contribute to safety, drivers need to be well-informed about the systems that they use.</p>
      <p class="normal">In addition to user experience and the manufacturer’s instructions, drivers should be able to obtain information from the point of sale.</p>
      <p class="normal">Therefore, this recommendation requires that suitable information exists and/or that point-of-sale personnel have adequate knowledge in order to inform purchasers of the safety issues.</p>
      <p class="normal">Examples:</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Good</span>: All point-of-sale personnel involved with customers have basic knowledge concerning safe use of information and communication systems. In addition, certain personnel have more in-depth knowledge and can advise drivers about safe practice.</p>
      <p class="normal">
         <span class="italic">Bad</span>: No-one at the point of sale is aware of the information systems, how they function and the safety issues associated with their use. There is also no information available to potential purchasers.</p>
      <p class="normal">Applicability:</p>
      <p class="normal">The recommendation applies to first sale of all in-vehicle information and communication systems.</p>
      <p class="normal">Verification/applicable methods:</p>

      <p class="normal">The primary need is for all sections of industry to be aware of the ESoP 2006 and RSU and to include the principles within their considerations of design and use of in-vehicle systems.</p>
      <p class="normal">For vehicle OEMs, a key organisation is ACEA, which committed itself to the principles contained in the 1999 ESoP. ACEA is invited to similarly endorse the 2006 ESoP and ensure that it is distributed and acknowledged within their industry, including their supply chains.</p>
      <p class="normal">Additional industry stakeholders are involved with nomadic devices and the products and services that they support. There is no single appropriate industry body, but many of the issues specific to the design of nomadic devices and their use and integration within vehicles can be discussed through the Nomadic Devices Forum. This deserves strong support across industry.</p>
      <p class="normal">An important objective for the Nomadic Devices Forum is achieving an agreement over definitions and safety issues:</p>

Their procedures and incentive schemes should not cause or encourage system misuse. There should be a clear distinction between systems or functions that are intended (by the employer) to be used while driving and those that are not.</p>
      <p class="normal">Furthermore, they should ensure that employees can use the systems without endangering themselves or other road users.

      <p class="normal">They should ensure that regularly updated information is available on the definition and dynamics of the market for after-market and nomadic devices, so as to be informed about the evolution of the market and of the technologies, and so that the Commission can be informed about the evolution of the market.</p>
      <p class="normal">They should ensure that their data collection is sufficiently detailed to enable further evaluation and monitoring of the safety-related impact of in-vehicle information and communication systems, especially of after-market systems and nomadic devices.</p>
      <p class="normal">Furthermore, they should take appropriate measures (i.e. legislative, enforcement measures) to ensure secure fixing of after-market systems and nomadic devices.</p>
      <p class="normal">They should continue to actively enforce existing health and safety legislation concerning at-work driving practices.</p>
      <p class="normal">They should take measures, as they see appropriate, to ensure that use of nomadic devices by drivers while driving does not compromise traffic safety and, in particular, identify and take necessary steps to prevent unintended use or misuse of visual entertainment systems by drivers while driving (e.g. movies, TV, video games).</p>
