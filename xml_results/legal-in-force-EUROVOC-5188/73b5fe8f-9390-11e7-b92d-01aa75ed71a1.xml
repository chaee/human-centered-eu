Once the SIS II alert is created, all communication related to the alert and the purpose for its creation and execution of action to be taken shall be provided by SIRENE Bureaux. If a Member State wants to change channels of communication, the other parties have to be consulted in advance. Such a change of channel is possible only in specific cases.</p>

Parallel alerts in the SIS II and via Interpol within the Schengen area should be avoided. Alerts which are distributed via Interpol channels and which also cover the Schengen area or parts thereof shall bear the following indication: ‘except for the Schengen States’.</p>

Accordingly, consultation and cooperation are also required when a match occurs upon the uploading of a fingerprint record. Where such issues occur, the procedure described below shall be followed. Additionally, where an alias identity is revealed the procedure described in Section 2.12.2 shall be followed.</p>
            <p class="normal">The SIRENE Bureau shall ensure that only one alert exists in SIS II in accordance with national procedure in circumstances where a Member State wants to issue a new alert and the new alert conflicts with an alert already entered by the same Member State.</p>

               <span class="bold">Introduction</span>
            </p>
            <p class="normal">The exchange of information on third-country nationals on whom an alert has been issued under Article 24 of the SIS II Regulation allows Member States to take decisions in the case of entry or visa application. If the individual is already on the territory of the Member State, it allows national authorities to take the appropriate action for issuing residence permits, long-stay visas or expulsion. In this section references to visas concern long-stay visas, unless otherwise clearly explained (e.g. re-entry visa).</p>
            <p class="normal">Carrying out the information procedures laid down under Article 5(4) of the Schengen Borders Code and the consultation procedures laid down under Article 25 of the Schengen Convention, falls within the competence of the authorities responsible for border controls and issuing residence permits or visas. In principle, the SIRENE Bureaux shall be involved in these procedures only in order to transmit supplementary information directly related to the alerts (e.g. notification of a hit, clarification of identity) or to delete alerts.</p>
            <p class="normal">However, the SIRENE Bureaux may also be involved in transmitting supplementary information necessary for the expulsion of, or for refusing entry to, a third-country national; and, may be involved in transmitting any supplementary information further generated by these actions.</p>
            <p class="normal">Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council<a id="ntc27-L_2017231EN.01000902-E0027" href="#ntr27-L_2017231EN.01000902-E0027"> (<span class="super note-tag">27</span>)</a> is not applicable in Switzerland. Therefore in the case of hit on a third-country national who is the beneficiary of the right of free movement, normal consultation procedures shall be undertaken between Switzerland, the issuing Member State and any other Member State which may hold relevant information on the third-country national's right of free movement.</p>
            <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e4243-9-1">4.1.   <span class="bold">Entering an alert</span>
            </p>
            <p class="normal">According to Article 25 of the SIS II Regulation, specific rules apply to third-country nationals who are beneficiaries of the right of free movement within the meaning of Directive 2004/38/EC. The SIRENE Bureau shall, as far as possible, be able to make available any information that was used to assess whether an alert for refusal of entry or stay was entered for a beneficiary of the right of free movement<a id="ntc28-L_2017231EN.01000902-E0028" href="#ntr28-L_2017231EN.01000902-E0028"> (<span class="super note-tag">28</span>)</a>. In the exceptional case of entry of an alert on a third-country national enjoying the right of free movement, the SIRENE Bureau of the issuing Member State shall send an <span class="bold">M form</span> to all the other Member States, based on the information provided by the authority that has entered the alert (see Sections 4.6 and 4.7).</p>
            <p class="normal">In addition, Article 26 of the SIS II Regulation provides that, subject to certain specific conditions, alerts relating to third-country nationals who are the subject of a restrictive measure intended to prevent entry into or transit through the territory of Member States, taken in accordance with Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union<a id="ntc29-L_2017231EN.01000902-E0029" href="#ntr29-L_2017231EN.01000902-E0029"> (<span class="super note-tag">29</span>)</a>, shall also be entered. The alerts shall be entered and kept up-to-date by the competent authority of the Member State which holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the time of the adoption of the measure. If that Member State does not have access to SIS II or alerts under Article 24 of the SIS II Regulation the responsibility shall be taken up by the Member State which will holds the subsequent Presidency and has access to SIS II, including access to the alerts under Article 24 of the SIS II Regulation.</p>
            <p class="normal">Member States shall put in place the necessary procedures for entering, updating and deleting such alerts.</p>

            <p class="normal">Problems may occur when a third-country national who is subject of an alert for refusal of entry or stay unlawfully uses the identity of a citizen of a Member State in order to seek to gain entry. If such a situation is discovered the competent authorities in the Member States may be made aware of the correct use of the misused identity function within SIS II. Alerts for refusal of entry shall not be issued in the main identity of a citizen of a Member State.</p>

            <p class="normal">According to Article 5(4)(a) of the Schengen Borders Code, a third-country national who is subject to an alert for refusal of entry or stay and, at the same time, has a residence permit, long-stay visa or a re-entry visa granted by one of the Member States, shall be allowed entry for transit purposes to the Member State which granted the residence permit or re-entry visa, when crossing a border in a third Member State. The entry may be refused if this Member State has issued a national alert for refusal of entry. In both cases, at the request of the competent authority, the SIRENE Bureau of the Member State that the person is seeking to enter shall send the SIRENE Bureaux of the two Member States in question a message (an <span class="bold">H form</span> if the transit was allowed/a <span class="bold">G form</span> if the entry was refused) informing them of the contradiction and requesting that they consult each other in order to either delete the alert in SIS II or to withdraw the residence permit/visa. It may also request to be informed of the result of any consultation.</p>
            <p class="normal">If the third-country national concerned tries to enter the Member State which has entered the alert in SIS II, his/her entry may be refused by this Member State. However, at the request of the competent authority, the SIRENE Bureau of that Member State shall consult the SIRENE Bureau of the Member State that granted the residence permit or visa in order to allow the competent authority to determine whether there are sufficient reasons for withdrawing the residence permit/visa. The Member State which granted the residence permit or visa shall use an <span class="bold">O form</span> to inform the issuing Member State about the decision whether or not to withdraw the residence permit or visa. If this Member State decides to maintain the residence permit or visa, the alert shall be deleted. The person can, nevertheless, be put on a Member State's national list of alerts for refusal of entry.</p>
            <p class="normal">If this person tries to enter the Member State that issued the residence permit or visa, he/she shall be allowed entry into the territory but the SIRENE Bureau of that Member State, at the request of the competent authority, shall consult the SIRENE Bureau of the issuing Member State in order to enable the competent authorities concerned to decide on withdrawal of the residence permit or visa or deletion of the alert. The Member State which granted the residence permit or visa shall use an <span class="bold">O form</span> to inform the issuing Member State about the decision whether or not to withdraw the residence permit or visa. If this Member State decides to maintain the validity of the residence permit or visa, the alert shall be deleted. The person can, nevertheless, be put on a Member State's national list of alerts for refusal of entry.</p>

Where it is clear that the serial numbers are identical but the objects are clearly not the same no consultation between SIRENE Bureaux is required. Users may be made aware that this situation can arise. Additionally, it is possible that an object, such as a passport or car, has been stolen and reported in one country and is subsequently reported in the country of origin. This could result in two alerts for the same object. If this matter comes to light it may be resolved by the SIRENE Bureaux concerned.</p>
