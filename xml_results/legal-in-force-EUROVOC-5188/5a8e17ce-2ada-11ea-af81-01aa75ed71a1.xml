For bundled services it should not exceed three single-sided A4 pages when printed with an easily readable font. A longer length could be justified, for example, for reasons of accessibility for consumers with disabilities. In order to ensure comparability between electronic communications service offers, the layout of the contract summary should include clearly distinguishable headings under which the different elements should be grouped. To facilitate understanding and a swift identification of important information by the consumers, the relevant elements under each heading should be described in short sentences. For reasons of readability and printability, sufficient margins should be left between the edges and the text of the contract summary.</p>

Where read from a close distance, a font size of at least 10 points is considered easily readable for many consumers. Headings should be clearly distinguishable from the text, for example by increased font size. Commonly used sans-serif fonts could be used to improve readability. Easy readability should also be ensured by using sufficient contrast, following state of the art practices, between the font and the background, especially when using colours.</p>
