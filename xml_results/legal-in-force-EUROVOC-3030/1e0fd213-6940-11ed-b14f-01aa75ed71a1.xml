            <p class="oj-normal">Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have unlocked new possibilities to support and sustain peace and security, for instance, through technological improvements in areas such as conflict early warning, and arms and export control verification. On the other hand, these advances have enabled new means to generate—or aggravate—tensions, conflicts and insecurity between and within states. The risks posed by certain applications of AI, such as lethal autonomous weapons systems, have emerged as a major issue of concern for the arms control community. One risk pathway that deserves greater attention, and which current arms control and diplomatic efforts may be insufficient in responding to, is the diversion and misuse of civilian AI research and innovation by irresponsible actors, including malicious non-state actors, such as the misuse of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to produce ‘deepfakes’ for disinformation campaigns.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">AI is an enabling technology with great general-use potential. AI research and innovation that are developed for civilian applications could be (relatively easily) accessed and repurposed by certain actors for harmful or disruptive uses that could have implications for international peace and security. The diversion and misuse of civilian technology are not new phenomena nor are they unique to AI. In the related field of robotics, this was recently exemplified by the weaponization and use of recreational drones by Daesh/ISIS in Syria. But in the case of AI, the problem is complicated by multiple factors: the intangible and fast-changing nature of AI algorithms and data, which makes the transfer/proliferation of these difficult to control; the leading role of the private sector in the research, development and innovation ecosystem, and its consequent need to protect proprietary algorithms; and the global availability of the human expertise and material resources capable of repurposing AI technologies. Meanwhile, those working in AI in the civilian sector remain too often unaware of the potential implications that the diversion and misuse of their work could have for international peace and security or are hesitant to take part in the existing discussions on AI risks in arms control and non-proliferation circles.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">There is a need to support greater engagement of the civilian AI community in understanding and mitigating the peace and security risks associated with the diversion and misuse of civilian AI technology by irresponsible actors. For the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), this could be achieved through greater promotion of responsible innovation in the global civilian AI community. Past work by SIPRI and UNODA has shown that responsible innovation, as a self-governance mechanism, could provide the global civilian AI community with practical tools and methods to identify as well as help prevent and mitigate the risks that the diversion and misuse of civilian AI research and innovation could pose to peace and security. SIPRI’s and UNODA’s work also identified methodologies and several ongoing civilian-focused initiatives on responsible AI that could be built on to sensitize the civilian AI community to arms control and non-proliferation issues, expert debates and state positions on responsible development, diffusion, and use of AI, as well as lessons to be learned from defence sector responsibility work. <a id="ntc1-L_2022300EN.01001401-E0001" href="#ntr1-L_2022300EN.01001401-E0001"
                  >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">1</span>)</a> Critically, this prior work has clearly identified engagement with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) students, who are still engaging with AI in an educational format, as central to any effective responsible innovation effort.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="oj-normal">These projects aim to support greater engagement of the civilian AI community in mitigating the risks that the diversion and misuse of civilian AI research and innovation by irresponsible actors may pose to international peace and security. They aim to do so by, firstly, generating greater understanding of how decisions in the development and diffusion of AI research and innovation can impact the risks of diversion and misuse, and in turn generate risk or opportunities for peace and security, and secondly, by promoting responsible innovation processes, methods and tools which can help ensure the peaceful application of civilian innovations and the responsible dissemination of AI knowledge. To this end, they support capacity-building, research and engagement activities that will <span class="oj-italic">i</span>) enhance the capacity within the global civilian AI community to include and address the peace and security risks presented by the diversion and misuse of civilian AI by irresponsible actors through responsible innovation processes; and <span class="oj-italic">ii</span>) strengthen the connection between risk mitigation efforts in responsible AI in the civilian sphere with those already ongoing in the disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation community at an intergovernmental level. Crucially, they do not intend to establish any new standards, principles, or regulation, or otherwise step into areas within the competence of States. Instead, they intend to develop civilian responsible innovation efforts to include peace and security risks presented by the diversion and misuse of civilian AI by irresponsible actors, and provide education on existing relevant intergovernmental efforts.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Such an approach allows the projects to reach the AI community at all levels, including not only current practitioners but also future generations. It also enables engagement across academic, industry and other silos, and supports the sustainability of future efforts by establishing networks that cross these boundaries.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The projects also seek to employ the convening power and experience of SIPRI and UNODA to impact the AI community globally, not just EU stakeholders. SIPRI and UNODA are uniquely positioned to reach and facilitate engagement between AI actors from across Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North and South America. Both entities also have experience working in other fields of science and technology facing similar challenges of dual use and proliferation, including biotechnology. The projects also seek to take advantage of conditions present within the European Union, such as a) the existence of advanced multi-stakeholder processes on responsible AI; b) the high level of engagement in, and expertise on, disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation issues in the EU; c) the diversity of connections that academic, research and private sector organizations in the EU have with other regions, notably in the Global South, which will also be a major target for engagement; and d) the diversity of nationalities of students, educators, and engineers in universities, research institutions and the private sector.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">This is expected to advance the engagement of the civilian AI sector in mitigating the risks that the diversion and misuse of civilian AI may pose to international peace and security; improve the capacity of technical practitioners to engage with relevant processes in disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation community as well as support the engagement of new audiences not traditionally included in disarmament and non-proliferation education efforts.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The material is also expected to support the implementation of the other projects and will serve as a basis for the educational and capacity-building activities in Project 2 as well as dialogue and engagement activities in Project 3. These activities are expected in turn to feed back into the production and refinement of the material. Such an iterative approach is expected to help address potential obstacles to their promotion, diffusion and use within the AI community, including issues related to language, content, context and availability, which could preclude their impact at the global level, particularly in the Global South.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The purpose of Project 2 is to support the integration of the problem of the diversion and misuse of civilian AI research by irresponsible actors in the education of future generations of AI practitioners. In the long term, this will ensure that the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) students shaping the future of AI are aware of the negative impacts that the diversion and misuse of their work by irresponsible actors could have on international peace and security and that they will have the basic tools necessary to identify and mitigate such a risk in the research and innovation process.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">This project will conduct a series of educational and capacity-building workshops with educators and students in collaboration with selected international universities and industry actors. The project thereby seeks to develop capacity-building activities that educators and developers of academic curricula could use to include in the training of future AI practitioners (e.g. courses on AI ethics and responsible innovation) and considerations for the risks of diversion and misuse of civilian AI research and innovation by irresponsible actors and connect those to the larger peace and security context. Through these workshops, the project will also seek to identify a network of interested educators, curriculum developers and students who would support the dissemination and promotion of the project education material and capacity-building activities in the AI education community and AI practitioner community. This networking component seeks to ensure the sustainability of the projects beyond their immediate duration and to enable the building of stronger links in support of civilian technical engagement towards larger peace, security, disarmament and arms control goals.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">This project will conduct a series of educational and capacity-building workshops with educators and students from selected universities from around the world. These would consist of a mix of lectures and interactive activities that will provide educators and students with opportunities to reflect on how civilian AI research and innovation could be diverted and misused in ways that may present risks to international peace and security and how on such risks can be identified, prevented or mitigated in the research and innovation process, or through other governance processes. These activities will build on prior smaller-scale pilot work carried out by UNODA which experimented with methods to engage with and sensitize STEM students to the importance of considering the wider impact of their work as well as engage with expertise outside of their home fields.

            </p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The project is expected to create models of capacity building and engagement activities that educators and developers of academic curricula could replicate to sensitize future AI practitioners to the problems of the diversion and misuse of civilian AI by irresponsible actors and how they can help mitigate these problems through responsible innovation processes. After completing the project activities, the participants (educators, but also STEM students) will be expected to be able to use and promote responsible innovation tools, methods and concepts to identify and mitigate the risks of diversion and misuse in the development and diffusion of civilian AI research and innovation.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The project activities are also expected to generate a network of educators, curriculum developers and students who would not only promote the project activities within the AI education and professional communities (e.g. during conferences of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society) but also be available to contribute with technical capacity to state-led international governance processes (e.g. the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons’ process on emerging technologies in the area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems).</p>

            </p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The purpose of Project 3 is to facilitate the longer-term sustainable development, dissemination and impact of responsible innovation in AI as a means of mitigating the risks that the diversion and misuse of civilian AI research and innovation may pose to peace and security. It aims to do so through roundtables with the AI industry, multi-stakeholder dialogues, the creation of a public report, and targeted dissemination activities. The project aims to ensure that the work generated, particularly the education, capacity-building and engagement activities, reaches and impacts the AI community at large, at all levels (from students to engineers and other AI professionals) and across geographical, sectorial, and other boundaries. To increase the possibility to make a broad and deep impact, it is essential to cooperate with professional organizations in this space, such as the IEEE, and conduct multi-dimensional engagements across academia, industry and other silos. Such efforts will give the opportunity to interested representatives from different AI communities to take ownership of the problem and provide their own views about how risk-mitigation efforts may be carried out and promoted sustainably within and across the global AI community. It is also important for the long-term value of the project to states, intergovernmental organizations and others that AI practitioners can learn from and engage with governmental experts engaged in risk mitigation in the disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation context. It is also critical for sustainability to ensure that the insights generated through the engagement activities are analysed, consolidated and disseminated appropriately.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="oj-normal">This project is expected to set the foundations for the sustainable development, dissemination and impact of the responsible innovation of AI processes addressing diffusion, diversion and misuse risks and their implications for peace and security beyond the immediate duration of the council decision.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The multi-stakeholder dialogue is expected to provide a model for information sharing and collaboration on risk mitigation not only within the global AI community but also between the civilian-responsible AI community and the disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation communities. Such a model could be used to familiarize policy makers with key technological and scientific advances relevant to the responsible innovation of AI and also familiarize technical audiences with the environment in which policy makers are currently engaging. The project is expected to facilitate sustainable relationships and engagement between interested actors within and across these different communities. Such heterogenous network effects are expected to enable the greater development and widespread promotion of the responsible innovation of AI for peace and security beyond the timeframe of the project.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The private sector dialogue is expected to enable greater and deeper engagement of the AI private sector in the identification, prevention and mitigation of the peace and security risks stemming from the diversion and misuse of civilian AI research and innovation. The project is expected to give key actors in private sector processes greater understanding and ownership of the problems it seeks to address. In addition, it aims to facilitate the (wider) adoption and implementation of responsible innovation processes, methods and means in existing corporate risk management mechanisms and procedures.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The multi-stakeholder dialogue and the private sector roundtable are also expected to generate insights on a number of substantial issues, including a) how responsible innovation methods and means can be further refined and deployed to identify, prevent and mitigate risks posed by the diversion and misuse of civilian AI research and innovation; b) how AI research and innovation can be used positively to support peace and security objectives (e.g. applications for conflict early warning and humanitarian assistance); and c) how to facilitate greater dialogue and information sharing between risk mitigation efforts undertaken in the civilian-responsible AI community (i.e. various IEEE-led initiatives) with those already ongoing in the disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation community at an intergovernmental level.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The report and dissemination activities will analyse, consolidate and disseminate insights generated through Projects 1, 2 and 3, and thus support the promotion of the findings and recommendations of the project activities within the global AI community, as well as within the policy community. They are also expected to help ensure sustainability of impact beyond the timeframe of the projects.</p>
