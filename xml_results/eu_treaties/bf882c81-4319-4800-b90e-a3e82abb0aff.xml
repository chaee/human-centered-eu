This Treaty organises the functioning of the Union and determines the areas of, delimitation of, and arrangements for exercising its competences.</p><p>2. This Treaty and the Treaty on European Union constitute the Treaties on which the Union is founded. These two Treaties, which have the same legal value, shall be referred to as "the Treaties".</p><p>TITLE I</p><p>CATEGORIES AND AREAS OF UNION COMPETENCE</p><p>Article 2</p><p>1. When the Treaties confer on the Union exclusive competence in a specific area, only the Union may legislate and adopt legally binding acts, the Member States being able to do so themselves only if so empowered by the Union or for the implementation of Union acts.</p><p>2. When the Treaties confer on the Union a competence shared with the Member States in a specific area, the Union and the Member States may legislate and adopt legally binding acts in that area. The Member States shall exercise their competence to the extent that the Union has not exercised its competence. The Member States shall again exercise their competence to the extent that the Union has decided to cease exercising its competence.</p><p>3.

The scope of and arrangements for exercising the Union's competences shall be determined by the provisions of the Treaties relating to each area.</p><p>Article 3</p><p>1. The Union shall have exclusive competence in the following areas:</p><p>(a) customs union;</p><p>(b) the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market;</p><p>(c) monetary policy for the Member States whose currency is the euro;</p><p>(d) the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy;</p><p>(e) common commercial policy.</p><p>2. The Union shall also have exclusive competence for the conclusion of an international agreement when its conclusion is provided for in a legislative act of the Union or is necessary to enable the Union to exercise its internal competence, or in so far as its conclusion may affect common rules or alter their scope.</p><p>Article 4</p><p>1. The Union shall share competence with the Member States where the Treaties confer on it a competence which does not relate to the areas referred to in Articles 3 and 6.</p><p>2.

In the areas of research, technological development and space, the Union shall have competence to carry out activities, in particular to define and implement programmes; however, the exercise of that competence shall not result in Member States being prevented from exercising theirs.</p><p>4. In the areas of development cooperation and humanitarian aid, the Union shall have competence to carry out activities and conduct a common policy; however, the exercise of that competence shall not result in Member States being prevented from exercising theirs.</p><p>Article 5</p><p>1. The Member States shall coordinate their economic policies within the Union. To this end, the Council shall adopt measures, in particular broad guidelines for these policies.</p><p>Specific provisions shall apply to those Member States whose currency is the euro.</p><p>2. The Union shall take measures to ensure coordination of the employment policies of the Member States, in particular by defining guidelines for these policies.</p><p>3. The Union may take initiatives to ensure coordination of Member States' social policies.</p><p>Article 6</p><p>The Union shall have competence to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States.

The Union shall comprise a customs union which shall cover all trade in goods and which shall involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties on imports and exports and of all charges having equivalent effect, and the adoption of a common customs tariff in their relations with third countries.</p><p>2. The provisions of Article 30 and of Chapter 2 of this Title shall apply to products originating in Member States and to products coming from third countries which are in free circulation in Member States.</p><p>Article 29</p><p>(ex Article 24 TEC)</p><p>Products coming from a third country shall be considered to be in free circulation in a Member State if the import formalities have been complied with and any customs duties or charges having equivalent effect which are payable have been levied in that Member State, and if they have not benefited from a total or partial drawback of such duties or charges.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>THE CUSTOMS UNION</p><p>Article 30</p><p>(ex Article 25 TEC)</p><p>Customs duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States. This prohibition shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature.</p><p>Article 31</p><p>(ex Article 26 TEC)</p><p>Common Customs Tariff duties shall be fixed by the Council on a proposal from the Commission.</p><p>Article 32</p><p>(ex Article 27 TEC)</p><p>In carrying out the tasks entrusted to it under this Chapter the Commission shall be guided by:</p><p>(a) the need to promote trade between Member States and third countries;</p><p>(b) developments in conditions of competition within the Union in so far as they lead to an improvement in the competitive capacity of undertakings;</p><p>(c) the requirements of the Union as regards the supply of raw materials and semi-finished goods; in this connection the Commission shall take care to avoid distorting conditions of competition between Member States in respect of finished goods;</p><p>(d) the need to avoid serious disturbances in the economies of Member States and to ensure rational development of production and an expansion of consumption within the Union.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>CUSTOMS COOPERATION</p><p>Article 33</p><p>(ex Article 135 TEC)</p><p>Within the scope of application of the Treaties, the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall take measures in order to strengthen customs cooperation between Member States and between the latter and the Commission.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>PROHIBITION OF QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS BETWEEN MEMBER STATES</p><p>Article 34</p><p>(ex Article 28 TEC)</p><p>Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States.</p><p>Article 35</p><p>(ex Article 29 TEC)</p><p>Quantitative restrictions on exports, and all measures having equivalent effect, shall be prohibited between Member States.</p><p>Article 36</p><p>(ex Article 30 TEC)</p><p>The provisions of Articles 34 and 35 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.</p><p>Article 37</p><p>(ex Article 31 TEC)</p><p>1. Member States shall adjust any State monopolies of a commercial character so as to ensure that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of Member States.</p><p>The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which a Member State, in law or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervises, determines or appreciably influences imports or exports between Member States. These provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated by the State to others.</p><p>2. Member States shall refrain from introducing any new measure which is contrary to the principles laid down in paragraph 1 or which restricts the scope of the articles dealing with the prohibition of customs duties and quantitative restrictions between Member States.</p><p>3. If a State monopoly of a commercial character has rules which are designed to make it easier to dispose of agricultural products or obtain for them the best return, steps should be taken in applying the rules contained in this Article to ensure equivalent safeguards for the employment and standard of living of the producers concerned.</p><p>TITLE III</p><p>AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES</p><p>Article 38</p><p>(ex Article 32 TEC)</p><p>1. The Union shall define and implement a common agriculture and fisheries policy.</p><p>The internal market shall extend to agriculture, fisheries and trade in agricultural products. "Agricultural products" means the products of the soil, of stockfarming and of fisheries and products of first-stage processing directly related to these products. References to the common agricultural policy or to agriculture, and the use of the term "agricultural", shall be understood as also referring to fisheries, having regard to the specific characteristics of this sector.</p><p>2. Save as otherwise provided in Articles 39 to 44, the rules laid down for the establishment and functioning of the internal market shall apply to agricultural products.</p><p>3. The products subject to the provisions of Articles 39 to 44 are listed in Annex I.</p><p>4. The operation and development of the internal market for agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy.</p><p>Article 39</p><p>(ex Article 33 TEC)</p><p>1. The objectives of the common agricultural policy shall be:</p><p>(a) to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour;</p><p>(b) thus to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture;</p><p>(c) to stabilise markets;</p><p>(d) to assure the availability of supplies;</p><p>(e) to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.</p><p>2. In working out the common agricultural policy and the special methods for its application, account shall be taken of:</p><p>(a) the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions;</p><p>(b) the need to effect the appropriate adjustments by degrees;</p><p>(c) the fact that in the Member States agriculture constitutes a sector closely linked with the economy as a whole.</p><p>Article 40</p><p>(ex Article 34 TEC)</p><p>1. In order to attain the objectives set out in Article 39, a common organisation of agricultural markets shall be established.</p><p>This organisation shall take one of the following forms, depending on the product concerned:</p><p>(a) common rules on competition;</p><p>(b) compulsory coordination of the various national market organisations;</p><p>(c) a European market organisation.</p><p>2. The common organisation established in accordance with paragraph 1 may include all measures required to attain the objectives set out in Article 39, in particular regulation of prices, aids for the production and marketing of the various products, storage and carryover arrangements and common machinery for stabilising imports or exports.</p><p>The common organisation shall be limited to pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 39 and shall exclude any discrimination between producers or consumers within the Union.</p><p>Any common price policy shall be based on common criteria and uniform methods of calculation.</p><p>3. In order to enable the common organisation referred to in paragraph 1 to attain its objectives, one or more agricultural guidance and guarantee funds may be set up.</p><p>Article 41</p><p>(ex Article 35 TEC)</p><p>To enable the objectives set out in Article 39 to be attained, provision may be made within the framework of the common agricultural policy for measures such as:</p><p>(a) an effective coordination of efforts in the spheres of vocational training, of research and of the dissemination of agricultural knowledge; this may include joint financing of projects or institutions;</p><p>(b) joint measures to promote consumption of certain products.</p><p>Article 42</p><p>(ex Article 36 TEC)</p><p>The provisions of the Chapter relating to rules on competition shall apply to production of and trade in agricultural products only to the extent determined by the European Parliament and the Council within the framework of Article 43(2) and in accordance with the procedure laid down therein, account being taken of the objectives set out in Article 39.</p><p>The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise the granting of aid:</p><p>(a) for the protection of enterprises handicapped by structural or natural conditions;</p><p>(b) within the framework of economic development programmes.</p><p>Article 43</p><p>(ex Article 37 TEC)</p><p>1. The Commission shall submit proposals for working out and implementing the common agricultural policy, including the replacement of the national organisations by one of the forms of common organisation provided for in Article 40(1), and for implementing the measures specified in this Title.</p><p>These proposals shall take account of the interdependence of the agricultural matters mentioned in this Title.</p><p>2. The European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, shall establish the common organisation of agricultural markets provided for in Article 40(1) and the other provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy.</p><p>3. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations and on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.</p><p>4. In accordance with paragraph 1, the national market organisations may be replaced by the common organisation provided for in Article 40(1) if:</p><p>(a) the common organisation offers Member States which are opposed to this measure and which have an organisation of their own for the production in question equivalent safeguards for the employment and standard of living of the producers concerned, account being taken of the adjustments that will be possible and the specialisation that will be needed with the passage of time;</p><p>(b) such an organisation ensures conditions for trade within the Union similar to those existing in a national market.</p><p>5. If a common organisation for certain raw materials is established before a common organisation exists for the corresponding processed products, such raw materials as are used for processed products intended for export to third countries may be imported from outside the Union.</p><p>Article 44</p><p>(ex Article 38 TEC)</p><p>Where in a Member State a product is subject to a national market organisation or to internal rules having equivalent effect which affect the competitive position of similar production in another Member State, a countervailing charge shall be applied by Member States to imports of this product coming from the Member State where such organisation or rules exist, unless that State applies a countervailing charge on export.</p><p>The Commission shall fix the amount of these charges at the level required to redress the balance; it may also authorise other measures, the conditions and details of which it shall determine.</p><p>TITLE IV</p><p>FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS, SERVICES AND CAPITAL</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>WORKERS</p><p>Article 45</p><p>(ex Article 39 TEC)</p><p>1.

Save as otherwise provided in the Treaties, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market.</p><p>2. The following shall be compatible with the internal market:</p><p>(a) aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers, provided that such aid is granted without discrimination related to the origin of the products concerned;</p><p>(b) aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences;</p><p>(c) aid granted to the economy of certain areas of the Federal Republic of Germany affected by the division of Germany, in so far as such aid is required in order to compensate for the economic disadvantages caused by that division.

If, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds that aid granted by a State or through State resources is not compatible with the internal market having regard to Article 107, or that such aid is being misused, it shall decide that the State concerned shall abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission.</p><p>If the State concerned does not comply with this decision within the prescribed time, the Commission or any other interested State may, in derogation from the provisions of Articles 258 and 259, refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union direct.</p><p>On application by a Member State, the Council may, acting unanimously, decide that aid which that State is granting or intends to grant shall be considered to be compatible with the internal market, in derogation from the provisions of Article 107 or from the regulations provided for in Article 109, if such a decision is justified by exceptional circumstances. If, as regards the aid in question, the Commission has already initiated the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the fact that the State concerned has made its application to the Council shall have the effect of suspending that procedure until the Council has made its attitude known.</p><p>If, however, the Council has not made its attitude known within three months of the said application being made, the Commission shall give its decision on the case.</p><p>3.

Paragraph 1 shall not apply to fiscal provisions, to those relating to the free movement of persons nor to those relating to the rights and interests of employed persons.</p><p>3. The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection, taking account in particular of any new development based on scientific facts. Within their respective powers, the European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective.</p><p>4. If, after the adoption of a harmonisation measure by the European Parliament and the Council, by the Council or by the Commission, a Member State deems it necessary to maintain national provisions on grounds of major needs referred to in Article 36, or relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment, it shall notify the Commission of these provisions as well as the grounds for maintaining them.</p><p>5. Moreover, without prejudice to paragraph 4, if, after the adoption of a harmonisation measure by the European Parliament and the Council, by the Council or by the Commission, a Member State deems it necessary to introduce national provisions based on new scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment on grounds of a problem specific to that Member State arising after the adoption of the harmonisation measure, it shall notify the Commission of the envisaged provisions as well as the grounds for introducing them.</p><p>6. The Commission shall, within six months of the notifications as referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, approve or reject the national provisions involved after having verified whether or not they are a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States and whether or not they shall constitute an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.</p><p>In the absence of a decision by the Commission within this period the national provisions referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be deemed to have been approved.</p><p>When justified by the complexity of the matter and in the absence of danger for human health, the Commission may notify the Member State concerned that the period referred to in this paragraph may be extended for a further period of up to six months.</p><p>7. When, pursuant to paragraph 6, a Member State is authorised to maintain or introduce national provisions derogating from a harmonisation measure, the Commission shall immediately examine whether to propose an adaptation to that measure.</p><p>8. When a Member State raises a specific problem on public health in a field which has been the subject of prior harmonisation measures, it shall bring it to the attention of the Commission which shall immediately examine whether to propose appropriate measures to the Council.</p><p>9. By way of derogation from the procedure laid down in Articles 258 and 259, the Commission and any Member State may bring the matter directly before the Court of Justice of the European Union if it considers that another Member State is making improper use of the powers provided for in this Article.</p><p>10. The harmonisation measures referred to above shall, in appropriate cases, include a safeguard clause authorising the Member States to take, for one or more of the non-economic reasons referred to in Article 36, provisional measures subject to a Union control procedure.</p><p>Article 115</p><p>(ex Article 94 TEC)</p><p>Without prejudice to Article 114, the Council shall, acting unanimously in accordance with a special legislative procedure and after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, issue directives for the approximation of such laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States as directly affect the establishment or functioning of the internal market.</p><p>Article 116</p><p>(ex Article 96 TEC)</p><p>Where the Commission finds that a difference between the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States is distorting the conditions of competition in the internal market and that the resultant distortion needs to be eliminated, it shall consult the Member States concerned.</p><p>If such consultation does not result in an agreement eliminating the distortion in question, the European, Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall issue the necessary directives.

The Economic and Financial Committee shall formulate an opinion on the report of the Commission.</p><p>5. If the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur, it shall address an opinion to the Member State concerned and shall inform the Council accordingly.</p><p>6.

If the Council has previously made public recommendations, it shall, as soon as the decision under paragraph 8 has been abrogated, make a public statement that an excessive deficit in the Member State concerned no longer exists.</p><p>13. When taking the decisions or recommendations referred to in paragraphs 8, 9, 11 and 12, the Council shall act on a recommendation from the Commission.</p><p>When the Council adopts the measures referred to in paragraphs 6 to 9, 11 and 12, it shall act without taking into account the vote of the member of the Council representing the Member State concerned.</p><p>A qualified majority of the other members of the Council shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(a).</p><p>14.

These reports shall include an examination of the compatibility between the national legislation of each of these Member States, including the statutes of its national central bank, and Articles 130 and 131 and the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB. The reports shall also examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of the following criteria:</p><p>- the achievement of a high degree of price stability; this will be apparent from a rate of inflation which is close to that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability,</p><p>- the sustainability of the government financial position; this will be apparent from having achieved a government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive as determined in accordance with Article 126(6),</p><p>- the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, for at least two years, without devaluing against the euro,</p><p>- the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State with a derogation and of its participation in the exchange-rate mechanism being reflected in the long-term interest-rate levels.</p><p>The four criteria mentioned in this paragraph and the relevant periods over which they are to be respected are developed further in a Protocol annexed to the Treaties.

In so doing, Member States shall take account of the experience acquired in cooperation within the framework of the exchange-rate mechanism.</p><p>Article 143</p><p>(ex Article 119 TEC)</p><p>1. Where a Member State with a derogation is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments either as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its balance of payments, or as a result of the type of currency at its disposal, and where such difficulties are liable in particular to jeopardise the functioning of the internal market or the implementation of the common commercial policy, the Commission shall immediately investigate the position of the State in question and the action which, making use of all the means at its disposal, that State has taken or may take in accordance with the provisions of the Treaties. The Commission shall state what measures it recommends the State concerned to take.</p><p>If the action taken by a Member State with a derogation and the measures suggested by the Commission do not prove sufficient to overcome the difficulties which have arisen or which threaten, the Commission shall, after consulting the Economic and Financial Committee, recommend to the Council the granting of mutual assistance and appropriate methods therefor.</p><p>The Commission shall keep the Council regularly informed of the situation and of how it is developing.</p><p>2. The Council shall grant such mutual assistance; it shall adopt directives or decisions laying down the conditions and details of such assistance, which may take such forms as:</p><p>(a) a concerted approach to or within any other international organisations to which Member States with a derogation may have recourse;</p><p>(b) measures needed to avoid deflection of trade where the Member State with a derogation which is in difficulties maintains or reintroduces quantitative restrictions against third countries;</p><p>(c) the granting of limited credits by other Member States, subject to their agreement.</p><p>3. If the mutual assistance recommended by the Commission is not granted by the Council or if the mutual assistance granted and the measures taken are insufficient, the Commission shall authorise the Member State with a derogation which is in difficulties to take protective measures, the conditions and details of which the Commission shall determine.</p><p>Such authorisation may be revoked and such conditions and details may be changed by the Council.</p><p>Article 144</p><p>(ex Article 120 TEC)</p><p>1. Where a sudden crisis in the balance of payments occurs and a decision within the meaning of Article 143(2) is not immediately taken, a Member State with a derogation may, as a precaution, take the necessary protective measures. Such measures must cause the least possible disturbance in the functioning of the internal market and must not be wider in scope than is strictly necessary to remedy the sudden difficulties which have arisen.</p><p>2. The Commission and the other Member States shall be informed of such protective measures not later than when they enter into force. The Commission may recommend to the Council the granting of mutual assistance under Article 143.</p><p>3.
