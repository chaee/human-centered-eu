In order to strengthen Union competitiveness and to boost growth, the Union needs to act swiftly and encourage economic actors to unleash the full potential offered by the internal market. The full potential of the internal market can only be unleashed if all market participants enjoy smooth access to cross-border sales of goods including in e-commerce transactions. The contract law rules on the basis of which market participants conclude transactions are among the key factors shaping business decisions as to whether to offer goods cross-border. Those rules also influence consumers' willingness to embrace and trust this type of purchase.</p>

While several factors contribute to this mistrust, uncertainty about key contractual rights ranks prominently among consumers' concerns. This uncertainty exists independently of whether or not consumers are protected by the mandatory consumer contract law rules of their own Member State in the event that sellers direct their cross-border activities to them, or of whether or not consumers conclude cross-border contracts with sellers without the respective seller pursuing commercial activities in the consumer's Member State.</p>

This Directive should cover all sales channels, in order to create a level playing field for all businesses selling goods to consumers. By laying down uniform rules across sales channels, this Directive should avoid any divergence that would create disproportionate burdens for the growing number of omni-channel retailers in the Union. The need for retaining consistent rules on sales and guarantees for all sales channels was confirmed in the Commission's Fitness Check on consumer and marketing law published on 29 May 2017, which also covered Directive 1999/44/EC.</p>

Accordingly, in order to meet the expectations of consumers and ensure a clear-cut and simple legal framework for traders of digital content or digital services, Directive (EU) 2019/770 applies to the supply of digital content or digital services, including digital content supplied on a tangible medium, such as DVDs, CDs, USB sticks and memory cards, as well as to the tangible medium itself, provided that the tangible medium serves exclusively as a carrier of the digital content. In contrast, this Directive should apply to contracts for the sale of goods, including goods with digital elements which require digital content or a digital service in order to perform their functions.</p>

Whether the supply of the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service forms part of the sales contract with the seller should depend on the content of this contract. This should include incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital services the supply of which is explicitly required by the contract. It should also include sales contracts which can be understood as covering the supply of specific digital content or a specific digital service because they are normal for goods of the same type and the consumer could reasonably expect them given the nature of the goods and taking into account any public statement made by or on behalf of the seller or other persons in previous links of the chain of transactions, including the producer. If, for example, a smart TV were advertised as including a particular video application, that video application would be considered to be part of the sales contract. This should apply regardless of whether the digital content or digital service is pre-installed in the good itself or has to be downloaded subsequently on another device and is only inter-connected to the good. For example, a smart phone could come with a standardised pre-installed application provided under the sales contract, such as an alarm application or a camera application. Another possible example is that of a smart watch. In such a case, the watch itself would be considered to be the good with digital elements, which can perform its functions only with an application that is provided under the sales contract but has to be downloaded by the consumer onto a smart phone; the application would then be the inter-connected digital element. This should also apply if the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service is not supplied by the seller itself but is supplied, under the sales contract, by a third party. In order to avoid uncertainty for both sellers and consumers, in the event of doubt as to whether the supply of the digital content or the digital service forms part of the sales contract, the rules of this Directive should apply. Furthermore, ascertaining a bilateral contractual relationship, between the seller and the consumer, of which the supply of the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service forms part should not be affected by the mere fact that the consumer has to consent to a licensing agreement with a third party in order to benefit from the digital content or the digital service.</p>

For instance, if the consumer downloads a game application from an app store onto a smart phone, the contract for the supply of the game application is separate from the contract for the sale of the smart phone itself. This Directive should therefore only apply to the sales contract concerning the smart phone, while the supply of the game application should fall under Directive (EU) 2019/770, if the conditions of that Directive are met. Another example would be where it is expressly agreed that the consumer buys a smart phone without a specific operating system and the consumer subsequently concludes a contract for the supply of an operating system from a third party. In such a case, the supply of the separately bought operating system would not form part of the sales contract and therefore would not fall within the scope of this Directive but could fall within the scope of Directive (EU) 2019/770, if the conditions of that Directive are met.</p>

However, the obligation to provide updates should reflect the fact that the digital environment of any such good constantly changes. Therefore, updates are a necessary tool in order to ensure that the goods are able to function in the same way that they did at the time of delivery. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional goods, goods with digital elements are not completely separate from the seller's sphere because the seller, or a third person supplying the digital content or digital service under the sales contract, is able to update the goods from a distance, usually over the internet. Therefore, if the digital content or digital service is supplied by a single act of supply, the seller should be liable to provide the updates necessary to keep the goods with digital elements in conformity for a period of time that the consumer can reasonably expect, even if the goods were in conformity at the time of delivery. The period of time during which the consumer can reasonably expect to receive updates should be assessed based on the type and purpose of the goods and the digital elements, and taking into account the circumstances and nature of the sales contract. A consumer would normally expect to receive updates for at least as long as the period during which the seller is liable for a lack of conformity, while in some cases the consumer's reasonable expectation could extend beyond that period, as might be the case particularly with regard to security updates. In other cases, for instance as regards goods with digital elements the purpose of which is limited in time, the seller's obligation to provide updates would normally be limited to that time.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Ensuring longer durability of goods is important for achieving more sustainable consumption patterns and a circular economy. Similarly, keeping non-compliant products out of the Union market by strengthening market surveillance and providing the right incentives to economic operators is essential in order to increase trust in the functioning of the internal market. For those purposes, product-specific Union legislation is the most appropriate means of introducing durability and other product-related requirements in relation to specific types or groups of products, using for this purpose adapted criteria. This Directive should therefore be complementary to the objectives pursued in such Union product-specific legislation, and should include durability as an objective criterion for the assessment of conformity of goods. Durability in this Directive should refer to the ability of the goods to maintain their required functions and performance through normal use. In order for goods to be in conformity, they should possess the durability which is normal for goods of the same type and which the consumer can reasonably expect given the nature of the specific goods, including the possible need for reasonable maintenance of the goods, such as the regular inspection or changing of filters in a car, and any public statement made by or on behalf of any person constituting a link in the chain of transactions. The assessment should also take into account all other relevant circumstances, such as the price of the goods and the intensity or frequency of the use that the consumer makes of the goods. In addition, insofar as specific durability information is indicated in any pre-contractual statement which forms part of the sales contract, the consumer should be able to rely on them as a part of the subjective requirements for conformity.</p>

The relevant time for assessing the conformity of the goods should be the time when the goods are delivered. This should also apply to goods which incorporate or are inter-connected with digital content or a digital service supplied through a single act of supply. However, where the digital content or digital service incorporated in or inter-connected with the goods is to be supplied continuously over a period of time, the relevant time for the purpose of establishing conformity of that digital content or digital service element should not be one specific moment in time but rather a period of time, starting from the time of delivery. For reasons of legal certainty, that period of time should be equal to the period during which the seller is liable for a lack of conformity.</p>

This means that the seller should also make the digital content or digital service available or accessible to the consumer in such a way that the digital content or digital service, or any means suitable for downloading or accessing it, has reached the sphere of the consumer and no further action is required by the seller in order to enable the consumer to use the digital content or digital service in accordance with the contract, for example by providing a link or a download option. Therefore, the relevant moment for establishing conformity should be the time when the digital content or digital service is supplied, if the physical component was delivered earlier. As a result, it can be ensured that there is a uniform starting point for the liability period for the physical component, on the one hand, and for the digital element on the other hand. Moreover, in many cases the consumer is unable to notice a defect in the physical component before the digital content or digital service is supplied.</p>

Given that when implementing Directive 1999/44/EC, a large majority of Member States have provided for a period of two years, and in practice that period is considered reasonable by market participants, that period should be maintained. The same period should apply in the case of goods with digital elements. However, where the contract provides for continuous supply for more than two years, the consumer should be entitled to remedies for any lack of conformity of the digital content or the digital service that occurs or becomes apparent within the period during which the digital content or digital service is to be supplied under the contract. In order to ensure that there is flexibility for Member States to increase the level of consumer protection in their national law, Member States should be free to provide for longer time limits for the liability of the seller than those laid down in this Directive.</p>

In the former case, Member States should ensure that the period for the seller's liability is not circumvented by the limitation period for the consumer's remedies. While this Directive should, therefore, not harmonise the starting point of national limitation periods, it should ensure that such limitation periods do not curtail the consumers' right to exercise their remedies for any lack of conformity which becomes apparent in the period during which the seller is liable for a lack of conformity. In the latter case, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce only a limitation period for the consumer's remedies, without introducing a specific period within which the lack of conformity has to become apparent in order for the seller to be liable. In order to ensure that consumers are equally protected also in such cases, Member States should ensure that where only a limitation period applies, it should still allow consumers to exercise the remedies for any lack of conformity that becomes apparent at least during the period of time provided for in this Directive as a liability period.</p>

Although a liability or limitation period of two years or more usually reconciles the interests of both the seller and the consumer, this might not be the case with regard to second-hand goods. Member States should, therefore, be allowed to enable the parties to agree on a shortened liability or limitation period for such goods. Leaving this question to a contractual agreement between the parties increases contractual freedom and ensures that the consumer has to be informed both about the nature of the good as a second-hand good, and the shortened liability or limitation period. However, such a contractually agreed period should not be shorter than one year.</p>

In addition, in some cases the presumption that the lack of conformity existed at the relevant time for establishing conformity could be incompatible with the nature of the goods or the nature of the lack of conformity. The former could be the case with goods that by nature deteriorate, such as perishable products, for example flowers, or goods which are only intended for a single use. An example of the latter would be a lack of conformity, which can only be a result of an action by the consumer or of an evident external cause which occurred after the goods were delivered to the consumer. In the case of goods with digital elements where the contract provides for continuous supply of the digital content or digital service, the consumer should not have to prove that the digital content or digital service was not in conformity during the respective period of time for establishing conformity.

Where the seller has taken action to bring the goods into conformity but a lack of conformity becomes apparent subsequently, it should be objectively determined whether the consumer should accept further attempts by the seller to bring the goods into conformity, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, such as the type and the value of the goods, and the nature and the significance of the lack of conformity. In particular, for expensive or complex goods it could be justified to allow the seller another attempt to remedy the lack of conformity. It should also be taken into account whether the consumer can be expected to maintain confidence in the ability of the seller to bring the goods into conformity or not, for instance, due to the same problem appearing twice. Similarly, in certain situations, the lack of conformity could be of such a serious nature that the consumer cannot maintain confidence in the ability of the seller to bring the goods into conformity, such as where the lack of conformity severely affects the ability of the consumer to make normal use of the goods and the consumer cannot be expected to trust that repair or replacement by the seller would remedy the problem.</p>

Finally, this Directive should provide rules on the content of the guarantee statement and on the way it should be made available to consumers.

Member States should be free to lay down rules on other aspects of commercial guarantees not covered by this Directive, for example on associating debtors other than the guarantor with the commercial guarantee, provided that those rules do not deprive consumers of the protection afforded to them by the fully harmonised provisions of this Directive on commercial guarantees. While Member States should remain free to require that commercial guarantees be provided free of charge, they should ensure that any undertaking by the seller or the producer which falls under the definition of commercial guarantees as set out in this Directive complies with the harmonised rules of this Directive.</p>
