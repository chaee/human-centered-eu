   DECISION (EU) 2017/2380 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
   of 12 December 2017
   amending Directive 2010/40/EU as regards the period for adopting delegated acts
   (Text with EEA relevance)
   THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91 thereof,
   Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
   After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
   Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee
    (,1)After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
   Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure
    (,2)Whereas:
            (1)
         Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council
             ( provides for the development of specifications for priority actions within priority areas.3)
            (2)
         Since the entry into force of Directive 2010/40/EU, four delegated acts relating to priority actions of that Directive have been adopted by the Commission. They address in particular eCall and data-sharing mechanisms that facilitate electronic data exchange between the relevant public authorities and stakeholders and the relevant intelligent transport systems (ITS) service providers. There is a need for further delegated acts regarding actions that are still to be addressed and that fall within the scope of Directive 2010/40/EU.
            (3)
         Under Article 12 of Directive 2010/40/EU, the power conferred on the Commission to adopt the delegated acts referred to in Article 7 of the Directive expires on 27 August 2017.
            (4)
         In order to achieve the objectives of Directive 2010/40/EU, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specifications necessary to ensure the compatibility, interoperability and continuity for the deployment and operational use of ITS for the priority actions for an additional period of five years starting from 27 August 2017. This period should be tacitly extended for periods of the same duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council oppose such an extension. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making
             (. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts,4)HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
