Provision must be made for the expenditure needed to update the system in line with the development of the veterinary legislation. Given the technical demands connected with the availability and stability of the Traces production environment as well as security requirements, computer equipment must be acquired and a dedicated monitoring and maintenance team must be put in place specifically for the system. The everyday use of the system also calls for suitable logistical support to be made available.2)

         The notification system introduced under Council Directive 82/894/EEC of 21 December 1982 on the notification of animal diseases within the Community

            (3)
         In connection with the implementation of an information policy on animal protection, measures must be adopted for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 of 22 December 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1255/97
             (. In particular, studies are needed on the use of satellite navigation technology and the development of an information system compatible with existing systems, and more specifically Traces.5)
            (4)
         The animal protection information policy also calls for information to be disseminated on technical and scientific developments in this area and for a survey to be conducted of consumer attitudes to livestock welfare.
