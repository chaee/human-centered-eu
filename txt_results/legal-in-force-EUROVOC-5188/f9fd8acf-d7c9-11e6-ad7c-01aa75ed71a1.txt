   COMMISSION DECISION (EU, Euratom) 2017/46
   of 10 January 2017
   on the security of communication and information systems in the European Commission
   THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 249 thereof,
   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,
   Whereas:
            (1)
         The Commission's communication and information systems are an integral part of the functioning of the Commission and IT security incidents can have a serious impact on the Commission's operations as well as on third parties, including individuals, businesses and Member States.
            (2)
         There are many threats that can harm the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the Commission's communication and information systems and of the information processed therein. These threats include accidents, errors, deliberate attacks and natural events, and need to be recognised as operational risks.
            (3)
         Communication and information systems need to be provided with a level of protection commensurate with the likelihood, impact and nature of the risks to which they are exposed.
            (4)
         IT security in the Commission should ensure that the Commission's CISs protect the information they process and they function as they need to, when they need to, under the control of legitimate users.
            (5)
         The IT security policy of the Commission should be implemented in a manner which is consistent with the policies on security in the Commission.
            (6)
         The Security Directorate of the Directorate-General for Human Resources and Security has the general responsibility for security in the Commission under the authority and responsibility of the Member of the Commission responsible for security.
            (7)
         The Commission's approach should take into account EU policy initiatives and legislation on network and information security, industry standards and good practices, to comply with all relevant legislation and to allow interoperability and compatibility.
            (8)
         Appropriate measures should be developed and implemented by the Commission departments responsible for communication and information systems and IT security measures for protecting communication and information systems should be coordinated across the Commission to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.
            (9)
         Rules and procedures for access to information in the context of IT security, including IT security incident handling, should be proportionate to the threat to the Commission or its staff and compliant with the principles laid down in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council
             (, on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data and taking account of the principle of professional secrecy, as provided in Article 339 of the TFEU.1)
            (10)
         The policies and rules for communication and information systems processing EU classified information (EUCI), sensitive non-classified information, and unclassified information are to be fully in line with Commission Decisions (EU, Euratom) 2015/443
             ( and (EU, Euratom) 2015/4442) (.3)
            (11)
         There is a need for the Commission to review and update the provisions on the security of communication and information systems used by the Commission.
            (12)
         The Commission Decision C(2006) 3602 should therefore be repealed,
            HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

   5.   All CIS shall be identified, assigned to a system owner and recorded in an inventory.
   6.   The security requirements of all CIS shall be determined on the basis of their security needs and of the security needs of the information they process. CIS that provide services to other CIS may be designed to support specified levels of security needs.
   7.   IT security plans and IT security measures shall be proportionate to the security needs of the CIS.
