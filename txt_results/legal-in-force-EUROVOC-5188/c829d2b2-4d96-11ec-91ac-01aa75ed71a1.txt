      COMMISSION DECISION (EU) 2021/2054
         of 8 November 2021
         on the sectoral reference document on best environmental management practices, environmental performance indicators and benchmarks of excellence for the telecommunications and information and communication technologies (ICT) services sector for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
         (Text with EEA relevance)
         THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
         Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
         Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), repealing Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 and Commission Decisions 2001/681/EC and 2006/193/EC 
         (, and in particular Article 46(1) thereof,1)Whereas:
                  (1)
               Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 obliges the Commission to develop sectoral reference documents for specific economic sectors. The documents must include best environmental management practices, environmental performance indicators and, where appropriate, benchmarks of excellence and rating systems identifying environmental performance levels. Organisations registered, or preparing to become registered, under the eco-management and audit scheme established by Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 are required to take the sectoral reference documents into account when developing their environmental management system and when assessing their environmental performance in their environmental statement, or updated environmental statement, prepared in accordance with Annex IV to that Regulation.
                  (2)
               Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 required the Commission to establish a working plan setting out an indicative list of sectors to be considered priority sectors for the adoption of sectoral and cross-sectoral reference documents. The Commission has, in that working plan 
                  (, identified the telecommunications and information and communication technologies (ICT) services sector as a priority sector.2)
                  (3)
               The sectoral reference document for the telecommunications and ICT services sector should set out best environmental management practices for all telecommunications and ICT services providers, including telecommunication operators, ICT consultancy firms, data processing and hosting companies, software developers and publishers, broadcasters and installers of ICT equipment and sites. Specific environmental performance indicators and benchmarks of excellence for a particular best environmental management practice should also be given whenever possible and meaningful.
                  (4)
               By way of these best environmental management practices for that sector 
                  (, concrete actions to improve the overall environmental management of companies should be identified in four main areas. Those main areas, which are considered to best support the efforts of all telecommunications and ICT services providers, are cross cutting issues, data centres, electronic communication networks, and improving the energy and environmental performance in other sectors3)
                  (5)
               In order to allow organisations in the telecommunications and ICT services sector, environmental verifiers, national authorities, accreditation and licensing bodies and other operators sufficient time to prepare for the introduction of the sectoral reference document for the telecommunications and ICT services sector, the date of application of this Decision should be deferred.
                  (6)
               In developing the sectoral reference document, the Commission has consulted with Member States and other stakeholders in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009.
                  (7)
               The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 49 of Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009,
                  HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
         Article 1
            The sectoral reference document on best environmental management practices, sector environmental performance indicators and benchmarks of excellence for the telecommunications and information and communication technologies (ICT) services sector is set out in the Annex.
         Article 2
            This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the 
            Official Journal of the European Union.It shall apply from 25 March 2022.

            INTRODUCTION
            This Sectoral Reference Document (SRD) is based on a detailed scientific and policy report 
            ( (‘Best Practice Report’) developed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC).1)
            Relevant legal background
            The Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) was introduced in 1993, for voluntary participation by organisations, by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1836/93 
            (. Subsequently, EMAS has undergone two major revisions:2)
                  Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
                     (;3)
                  Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
                     An important new element of the latest revision, which came into force on 11 January 2010, is Article 46 on the development of SRDs. The SRDs have to include best environmental management practices (BEMPs), environmental performance indicators for the specific sectors and, where appropriate, benchmarks of excellence and rating systems identifying performance levels.
            How to understand and use this document
            The eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) is a scheme for voluntary participation by organisations committed to continuous environmental improvement. Within this framework, this SRD provides sector-specific guidance to the telecommunications and ICT services sector and points out a number of options for improvement as well as best practices.
            The document was written by the European Commission using input from stakeholders. A Technical Working Group, comprising experts and stakeholders of the sector, led by the JRC, discussed and ultimately agreed on the best environmental management practices, sector-specific environmental performance indicators and benchmarks of excellence described in this document; these benchmarks in particular were deemed to be representative of the levels of environmental performance that are achieved by the best performing organisations in the sector.
            The SRD aims to help and support all organisations that intend to improve their environmental performance by providing ideas and inspiration as well as practical and technical guidance.
            The SRD is primarily addressed to organisations that are already registered with EMAS; secondly to organisations that are considering registering with EMAS in the future; and thirdly to all organisations that wish to learn more about best environmental management practices in order to improve their environmental performance. Consequently, the objective of this document is to support all organisations in the telecommunications and ICT services sector to focus on relevant environmental aspects, both direct and indirect, and to find information on best environmental management practices, as well as appropriate sector-specific environmental performance indicators to measure their environmental performance, and benchmarks of excellence.
            How SRDs should be taken into account by EMAS-registered organisations:
            Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009, EMAS-registered organisations are to take SRDs into account at two different levels:
                     1.
                  When developing and implementing their environmental management system in light of the environmental reviews 
                        (Article 4(1)(b)):
                        Organisations should use relevant elements of the SRD when defining and reviewing their environmental targets and objectives in accordance with the relevant environmental aspects identified in the environmental review and policy, as well as when deciding on the actions to implement to improve their environmental performance.
                     2.
                  When preparing the environmental statement 
                        (Article 4(1)(d) and Article 4(4)):
                                 (a)
                              Organisations should consider the relevant sector-specific environmental performance indicators in the SRD when choosing the indicators 
                                    ( to use for their reporting of environmental performance.4)When choosing the set of indicators for reporting, they should take into account the indicators proposed in the corresponding SRD and their relevance with regards to the significant environmental aspects identified by the organisation in its environmental review. Indicators need only be taken into account where relevant to those environmental aspects that are judged as being most significant in the environmental review.
                                 (b)
                              When reporting on environmental performance and on other factors regarding environmental performance, organisations should mention in the environmental statement how the relevant best environmental management practices and, if available, benchmarks of excellence have been taken into account.
                                    They should describe how relevant best environmental management practices and benchmarks of excellence (which provide an indication of the environmental performance level that is achieved by best performers) were used to identify measures and actions, and possibly to set priorities, to (further) improve their environmental performance. However, implementing best environmental management practices or meeting the identified benchmarks of excellence is not mandatory, because the voluntary character of EMAS leaves the assessment of the feasibility of the benchmarks and of the implementation of the best practices, in terms of costs and benefits, to the organisations themselves.
                                    Similarly to environmental performance indicators, the relevance and applicability of the best environmental management practices and benchmarks of excellence should be assessed by the organisation according to the significant environmental aspects identified by the organisation in its environmental review, as well as technical and financial aspects.
                                 Elements of SRDs (indicators, BEMPs or benchmarks of excellence) not considered relevant with regards to the significant environmental aspects identified by the organisation in its environmental review should not be reported or described in the environmental statement.
            EMAS participation is an ongoing process. Every time an organisation plans to improve its environmental performance (and reviews its environmental performance) it shall consult the SRD on specific topics to find inspiration about which issues to tackle next in a step-wise approach.
            EMAS environmental verifiers shall check if and how the SRD was taken into account by the organisation when preparing its environmental statement (Article 18(5)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009).
            When undertaking an audit, accredited environmental verifiers will need evidence from the organisation of how the relevant elements of the SRD have been selected in light of the environmental review and taken into account. They shall not check compliance with the described benchmarks of excellence, but they shall verify evidence on how the SRD was used as a guide to identify indicators and proper voluntary measures that the organisation can implement to improve its environmental performance.
            Given the voluntary nature of EMAS and SRD, no disproportionate burdens should be put on the organisations to provide such evidence. In particular, verifiers shall not require an individual justification for each of the best practices, sector-specific environmental performance indicators and benchmarks of excellence which are mentioned in the SRD and not considered relevant by the organisation in light of its environmental review. Nevertheless, they could suggest relevant additional elements for the organisation to take into account in the future as further evidence of its commitment to continuous performance improvement.
            Structure of the Sectoral Reference Document
            This document consists of four chapters. Chapter 1 introduces EMAS’ legal background and describes how to use this document, while Chapter 2 defines the scope of this SRD. Chapter 3 briefly describes the different best environmental management practices (BEMPs) 
            ( together with information on their applicability. When specific environmental performance indicators and benchmarks of excellence could be formulated for a particular BEMP, these are also given. However, defining benchmarks of excellence was not possible for all BEMPs, either because of the limited availability of data or because of the specific conditions of each company and/or site (e.g. environmental and climate conditions for data centres, accessibility of remote base stations, etc.) vary to such an extent that a benchmark of excellence would not be meaningful. Even when benchmarks of excellence are given, these are 5)not meant as targets for all companies to reach or metrics to compare the environmental performance across companies of the sector, but rather as a measure of what is possible to help individual companies assess the progress they made and motivate them to improve further. Finally, Chapter 4 presents a comprehensive table with a selection of the most relevant environmental performance indicators, associated explanations and related benchmarks of excellence.2.   
            SCOPE
            This reference document addresses the environmental performance of the telecommunications and ICT services sector 
            (. The best environmental management practices (BEMPs) described in this document were identified as best practices that can support the efforts of all Telecommunications and ICT services providers, i.e. telecommunication operators, ICT consultancy firms, data processing and hosting companies, software developers and publishers, broadcasters, installers of ICT equipment and sites, etc. Large organisations that store and process large quantities of data on their clients, supply chain and/or products (e.g. public administrations, hospitals, universities, banks) can also find several BEMPs of relevance to their activities.6)The companies and organisation of the telecommunications and ICT services sector that fall under the scope of this report are listed below:

                  The ICT manufacturing industries (NACE Code 26.1, 26.2, 26.3 and 26.8), ICT trade industries (NACE Code 46.5), Installation of mainframe and similar computers (NACE Code 33.20) and recycling, reuse and repair of ICT equipment (NACE Code 95.1) are covered by the best practice report for the electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing sector 
                     (;7)
                     —
                  The ICT retail trade (NACE Code 47.1 and 47.4) can be considered covered by the best practice report for the retail trade sector 
                     (.8)This document covers the core business activities of organisations in the Telecommunications and ICT Services sector. Beyond the direct management of ICT assets, core business activities are considered to include also the relationship with key stakeholders, although limited to practices that telecommunications and ICT services providers can implement themselves (e.g. establishing environmental criteria during procurement of ICT equipment, providing information to customers on the energy consumption of devices provided to them).
            The management of offices and general company transport are also not included as these are common for all types of organisations and not specific to organisations in the Telecommunications and ICT Services sector. Besides, the best environmental management practices (BEMPs) related to mobility (business travel and employee commuting) and sustainability practices in offices are already developed in the document on BEMP in the Public Administration Sector 
            (. No BEMP that is specific to the Telecommunications and ICT Services buildings and transportation was identified in these areas.9)The manufacturing, retail and recycling of ICT equipment are not included in this study as they are covered in the documents on BEMP for other sectors.
            This report distinguishes between:

            BEST ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, SECTOR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND BENCHMARKS OF EXCELLENCE FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ICT SERVICES SECTOR
            3.1.   
            BEMPs for cross-cutting issues
            This section focuses on cross-cutting measures which could apply to all types of organisations in the telecommunications and ICT services sector at different levels (data centres, telecommunication networks, end-user devices, etc.).
            3.1.1.   
            Making the best use of an environmental management system
            ICT facilities have important environmental impacts through energy consumption, water consumption and waste generation. It is particularly important for telecommunications and ICT services companies to monitor their environmental impacts and implement an environmental management system to systematically minimise these impacts. It is considered best practice to:
            Define the organisation’s ICT needs and audit the existing ICT equipment, services and software.
            Measure, monitor and manage the environmental performance of ICT equipment infrastructure and facilities.
            Set objectives and action plans based on benchmarking and best practices.
            Ensure that set objectives and action plans are part of effective company-wide environmental policies, such as an energy efficiency strategy
            Applicability
            This BEMP is broadly applicable to all companies and organisation of the sector. However, the resources and means allocated to the process must be adapted to the size and the environmental impact of the site or the company. For small and mid-size companies, efforts needed must be assessed and validated.

                                 3.1.2.   
            Procurement of sustainable ICT products and services
            The selection and deployment of ICT products and services needs to be based on an integrated strategy to tackle their inherent environmental impacts, such as their energy consumption and the use of specific materials such as rare metals and chemicals. It is considered best practice to:
                     —
                  Assess the existing assets of ICT equipment and the needs in the procurement process preparation.
                     —
                  Include in the call for tender required specific environmental criteria to be met.
                     —
                  Provide training and guidance to end-users when deploying ICT solutions so they can make the best use of the products and services.
                     Establish energy and environmental performance criteria for ICT equipment provided to customers to help them reduce their environmental impact.
            Applicability
            The implementation of a policy for the procurement of sustainable ICT services and products is applicable in any company but will require specific skills on sustainability. Large organisations have greater potential to leverage influence over their suppliers, but SMEs may exert considerable influence over local suppliers.

            Optimising the energy consumption of end-user devices
            There is a large potential to reduce the energy consumption of end-user equipment used within the offices and facilities of telecommunications and ICT services companies thanks to specific power management measures. It is best practice to:
                  Adopt technical solutions:
                                 —
                              Installing appropriate devices in terms of energy performance and functionalities depending on the needs of users;
                                 —
                              Properly configuring equipment to minimise unnecessary functionalities and power consumption;
                                 —
                              Performing regular energy audits to check devices configuration and powered-off devices;
                                 —
                              Developing power management solutions using different types of power management modes (manual, default, through software) or using dedicated devices (smart power strip, etc.).
                  Adopt organisational solutions:
                                 —
                              Assessing individual user acceptance;
                                 —
                              Raising users’ awareness.
            Applicability
            This BEMP is applicable to both large and small companies, although SMEs might benefit more from techniques based on individual user awareness rather than deployment of automated controls, more suited to large companies. Implementing power management depends on the leadership’s commitment to support overall energy savings objectives and environmental performance. It is also dependant on the implication of the staff to contribute to the power management measures as well as support from the IT and procurement departments.

            Use of renewable and low carbon energy
            ICT facilities have a high carbon footprint due to intensive energy use. Electricity generation from renewable sources such as biomass, solar, wind and geothermal cooling systems, significantly reduces their carbon footprint. It is considered BEMP to:
                     —
                  Purchase third-party green electricity.
                     —

            Resource efficiency of ICT equipment through waste prevention, reuse and recycling
            Resource efficiency and appropriate waste management in the ICT sector is important because of the use of specific materials that need to be properly treated at end-of-life to avoid damage to human health and the environment. It also offers a large potential for limiting resource depletion through recycling. Specific waste management techniques can be implemented in order to improve waste management at each stage of the waste hierarchy in ICT companies. It is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Develop a waste prevention plan.
                     —
                  Promote LCA-based eco-design through procurement.
                     —
                  Increase the service life and limit the obsolescence of ICT equipment.
                     —
                  Implement systems to enable re-use of ICT equipment.
                     —
                  Ensure traceable collection and proper sorting of end-of-life ICT equipment.
            Applicability
                  The BEMP is in principle broadly applicable to all types of companies in this sector; in practice small companies may contract out some waste management operations. The ownership model of the equipment will also dictate the available options for resource efficiency.

            Minimising data traffic demand through green software
            While software does not directly consume energy, it greatly influences the energy efficiency of the ICT hardware on which it runs. However, a large share of software code does not take into account energy consumption, and opportunities exist to optimise software, reduce the volume of data processed and transmitted, and ultimately reduce the energy consumption of hardware.
            This BEMP is dedicated to practices that can be implemented either when developing new software or when optimising existing software, for servers and networks considering both mobile applications (for smartphones and tablets) and computer software (for laptop and desktop), as well as web portals and web-based applications. It is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Select or develop more energy efficient software that minimises power consumption of ICT equipment while running.
                     —
                  Design demand-adaptive software based on the assessment of end-users needs, in order to avoid energy over-consumption at usage phase and to limit the obsolescence of existing ICT devices.
                     —
                  Monitor the energy consumption of software to assess the real performance of the acquired software, or to assess the opportunity of improving the energy efficiency of existing software.

            BEMPs for data centres
            This section deals with practices that improve the environmental performance of the operations of data centres. Many of the techniques identified within this chapter can also be implemented in telecommunication central offices.
            There is a large variety of data centres and many different ways to categorise them; the following characteristics can be used to differentiate between data centres: the size of the data centre (determined by the physical area, number of servers and/or workload capacity); its geographical location; the purpose or type of the operator (e.g. enterprise data centres, co-location 
            (, co-hosting, or network operator facilities); and its security level (Tier I to IV). These characteristics all have an impact on the applicability of the following BEMPs to different data centres.11)3.2.1.   
            Implement an energy management system for data centres (including measuring, monitoring and management of ICT and other equipment)
            The energy consumption of data centres is responsible for a major share of their environmental impacts. It is therefore important for data centre operators to have a clear and detailed view on energy consumption at the appropriate granularity levels, and to systematically exploit all opportunities to minimise it. It is considered best practice to:
                     —
                  Implement an energy management system (e.g. ISO 50001 or through EMAS).
                     —
                  Audit existing equipment and services to ensure that all areas with potential for optimisation and consolidation are identified to maximise any unused capability prior to new material investment.
                     —
                  Install metering equipment capable of measuring energy consumption and environmental parameters at different levels (row, cabinet, rack or ICT device level).
                     —
                  Monitor and report key performance indicators on equipment utilisation, energy consumption and environmental conditions.
            Applicability
            General remarks on the applicability of data centre BEMPs apply. Most energy management best practices will be better suited to localised, mid-tier and enterprise-class data centres.

                                 3.2.2.   
            Define and implement a data management and storage policy
            Minimising the quantity of data stored onto drives and the computing capacity required to run applications, databases and services is a key measure to reduce the energy consumption of data centres by reducing the number of powered hardware (servers and storage devices). It is considered best practice to:
                     —
                  Implement an effective data management and storage policy to minimise the share of stored data either unnecessary, duplicated or does not require rapid access.
                     —
                  Deploy grid and virtualisation technologies to maximise the use of shared platforms.
                     —
                  Consolidate existing services and decommission unnecessary hardware (and virtual machines) to reduce the number of highly resilient and reliable hardware powered (servers, networking and storage equipment).
                     When properly implemented, these techniques lead to a reduction of the hardware purchased which also results in significant material resources savings.
            Applicability
            This BEMP is broadly applicable by all companies and organisations of the sector, irrespectively of their size, security level or purpose although application may be different for enterprises or colocation data centres. Even if virtualisation is more frequently used in bigger data centres, this technique can also be implemented in smaller server rooms.

                                 3.2.3.   
            Improve airflow management and design
            The reliability of IT systems depends on environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, dust, etc.) that must be ensured by appropriate control of the indoor air quality. Airflow management for data centres aims at avoiding air recirculation and mixing of cooling air supplied and hot air rejected from equipment. It is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Implement a hot aisle/cold aisle configuration for ICT equipment to ensure that hardware shares an air flow direction without mixing cold and hot air.
                     —
                  Ensure aisles separation and containment to avoid the recirculation of air around the servers.
                     —
                  Segregate ICT equipment according to their environmental requirement (mainly humidity and temperature) and provide appropriate airflows to separate environmental areas.
                     —
                  Improve the floor and ceiling design to reduce bypass air flow, to prevent re-circulated air, and to reduce obstructions created by cabling or other structures.
                     —
                  Adjust volumes and quality of supplied cooled air to the IT equipment needs (function of heat produced and environmental requirements), and provide a slight oversupply of air to minimise heated air recirculation.
                     Improved airflow management increases both the efficiency and the capacity of the cooling equipment, reduces the utilisation of fans and humidifiers (and their energy consumption) and minimise the production of waste heat.
            Applicability
            Most of these actions can only be implemented by the data centre operator since they require changes in operational conditions, evolutions of the design of the facility or installation of new equipment. Although the best practices identified can be implemented in data centres of any size, scale effects can be observed in larger data centres with shorter return on investments.

            Improve cooling management
            Cooling is needed to remove the heat produced by ICT equipment in a data centre or a network room and to ensure the right operating conditions for ICT equipment to perform reliably. Sizing the necessary cooling system of a data centre depends on the environment where the data centre is located, on the efficiency of the IT equipment used in the data centre and on the airflow management performance. It is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Maintain the cooling system in optimum condition depending on IT load requirements to preserve its efficiency.
                     —
                  Review and adapt the cooling system capacity by shutting down unused equipment and better taking into account specific equipment operating requirements.
                     —
                  Optimise and automate the cooling system output by connecting CRAC units or using smart and multifactor units.
            Applicability
            The BEMP is broadly applicable in all companies of the sector. Maintaining the cooling system and carrying out regular reviews of its capacities can be done in most data centres, irrespectively of their size, security level or purpose.
            However, automating the cooling system output can imply costs to purchase smart equipment, making it more appropriate for large size data centres.
            It must be noted that specific regulation and environmental guidance can conflict with the decrease of cooling needs. For instance, BREEAM and LEED give points for increasing insulation of data centres. An increased insulation of data centres will require additional cooling needs since the heat produced by servers cannot dissipate.

                                 3.2.5.   
            Review and adjust temperature and humidity settings
            ICT facilities are often overcooled, and the server intake temperature set point can be raised within the recommended or allowable temperature ranges (given in the manufacturer specifications) in order to reduce the cooling capacity and the energy consumption of the cooling system.
            A similar situation is generally observed regarding humidity, and the energy and water consumption of humidifiers can be reduced by allowing a broader range of humidity levels. It is therefore BEMP to:
                     —
                  Review and raise temperature set points of cooling systems if practical, to reduce cooling needs and maximise the use of economisers.
                     —
                  Review and change humidity settings of cooling systems if practical, to reduce the needs for humidifiers.
            Applicability
            The BEMP is broadly applicable to all types of companies in this sector. Raising temperature set points, adjusting volumes and quality of supplied cool air, and reviewing humidity settings can be done in most data centres, irrespectively of their size, security level or purpose, within the operational specification given by the server manufacturer and within acceptable working conditions.

            3.2.6.1.   
            Selection and deployment of environmentally friendly equipment for data centres
            The selection and deployment of ICT devices as well as cooling and power supply equipment needs to be based on an integrated strategy to minimise their overall environmental performance (energy use, water use, embodied energy, resource efficiency). It is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Implement a green procurement policy specific to data centres equipment, from process preparation to bid evaluation.
                     —
                  Select and install environmentally-performant servers and storage equipment; i.e. equipment with the option to enable power management features, equipment suitable for the data centre power density and cooling delivery capabilities, equipment meeting the expected environmental conditions (temperature and humidity), etc.
                     —
                  Select environmentally-performant cooling equipment; i.e. equipment with high CoP or variable speed controls, appropriately sized cooling units, centralised cooling systems, economisers, etc..
                     —
                  Select environmentally-performant power equipment; i.e. highly efficient UPS, modular UPS, etc.
            Applicability
            Techniques on green procurement and environmentally-performant servers are broadly applicable to any new and existing data centre.
            For cooling systems, the location of the data centre is a fundamental factor concerning the feasibility and the performance of a free cooling system. Alternative cooling systems such as liquid cooling or free-air cooling are most easily implemented in new data centres rather than existing ones. For power systems, the elements to take into consideration for the adoption of new, more efficient UPS systems vary depending on when a new infrastructure is being built or when upgrading an existing infrastructure.

            Planning of new data centres
            When building or upgrading a data centre, the planning phase offers the most significant opportunities to ensure its environmental performance. Data centres are often oversized to allow future extensions, which generates energy inefficiencies. In many cases, the building can prevent the data centre from upgrading to new and more energy efficient equipment. It is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Limit the level of physical infrastructure resilience and service availability according to business requirements.
                     —

            Applicability
            This BEMP is broadly applicable to all companies of the sector, being most relevant for localised, mid-tier and enterprise-class data centres. Building a data centre according to a modular architecture is particularly relevant for big data centres.

            Reuse of data centre waste heat
            As any electrical equipment, IT equipment requires power supply and produces waste heat while running. Data centres produce large quantities of waste heat, which is an opportunity for heat reuse. It is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Re-use the waste heat produced in some rooms of the data centre to provide low grade heating to industrial or office space (including other areas of the data centre).
            Applicability
            This BEMPs can be broadly implemented by any data centre regardless of its size, tier or purpose.

                                 3.2.7.3.   
            Design of the data centre building and physical layout
            The physical layout of the data centre influences significantly its cooling system performance, since cooled areas (where racks are located) may be unnecessarily located close to internal heat sources (such as mechanical or electrical equipment) or in areas heated by external sources (e.g. solar radiation). It is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Minimise direct solar heating of the cooled areas of the data centre, in order to minimise cooling requirements.
                     —
                  Locate cooling equipment in appropriate areas of the data centre, such as areas with free air movement, areas with sufficient space to optimise cooling performance, areas free of obstructions and free of equipment generating heat.
            Applicability
            This BEMP is most relevant for building new, enterprise-class data centres, as it aims to shape the aspect and structure of the new built data centre and can be costly to implement.

            (.12)3.3.1.   
            Improving the energy management of existing networks
            Due to end-user demand variability, traffic loads on electronic communication networks vary significantly over time and space. The energy consumption of modern telecommunications equipment is the highest when the equipment is operating at maximum traffic load, but it does not decrease much when the equipment is underutilised. A large part of the daily network energy consumption is thus spent for providing full system capacity, even when the actual traffic demand is much lower. It is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Measure the energy consumption of network elements by using smart energy meters and automated analysis.
                     —
                  Use smart stand-by functions to implement network energy management, and switch as many devices as possible to low consumption mode when the traffic load is low to adapt the overall capacity of the network to the demand.
                     —
                  Use dynamic power scaling opportunities to adapt the operation mode of network equipment to low or moderate traffic period times.
                     —
                  Take advantage of dynamic scheduling transmission to better manage data traffic, and to control the amount and the timing of data packet transmission.
                     —
                  Provide energy-aware services to reduce the traffic demand at peak load, as well as the overall capacity of the network.

            Installing and upgrading telecommunication networks
            Beyond the installation of new energy efficient equipment on network sites, organisational solutions can deliver significant energy savings, for instance, by ensuring that unused equipment is plugged off and power and cooling supply are not oversized and are optimised to the actual current needs. It is best practice to:
                     —
                  Take advantage of technology transition (e.g. deploying 5G technology in existing base station sites or for fixed stations switching from copper to fibre networks) to optimise network sites, undertaking decommissioning/switch off of the unused equipment, replacement of the obsolete equipment, proper configuration of the cooling systems, etc.
                     —
                  Put in place a decommissioning plan through the integration of such practices in a management process focused on upgrading base station sites.
            Applicability
            This BEMP is more relevant for large mobile companies which own thousands of sites, and for operators of networks in rural areas (where the sites are more spaced out). Telecommunication operators and their suppliers in charge of the installation of ICT equipment are the main actors concerned by this BEMP.

            Reducing the environmental impacts when building or renovating telecommunication networks
            Telecommunication and broadcasting infrastructures generate neighbourhood nuisances (aesthetic impact, noise from generators and cooling system, etc.) and are responsible for land-use (potentially associated with biodiversity disturbance). To limit such impacts when building new infrastructures or when renovating existing ones, it is BEMP to:
                     —
                  Plan capacity and forecast demand ahead of building or renovation
                     —
                  Co-locate ICT infrastructures, in order to limit the number of different infrastructures.
                     —
                  Locate network infrastructures (fixe-lined, antennas, buildings, etc.) close to existing access roads and out of conservation areas
                     —
                  Install noise reducing solutions, such as barriers, absorptive material or mufflers.

            Improving the energy and environmental performance in other sectors (‘ Greening by ICT’)
            This section deals with practices focussing on the most relevant opportunities for the telecommunications and ICT service sector to contribute to improving the environmental performance of other sectors.
            3.4.1.   
            Greening by ICT
            Across all sectors, four main change levers for reducing GHG emissions and improving environmental performance in general through ICT are available:
                     —
                  Digitalisation and dematerialisation
                     —
                  Data collection and communication
                     —
                  System integration
                     —
                  Process, activity, and functional optimisation
                     These solutions are closely related to one another and complementary. They apply at different lifecycle stages: while developing the services or products, between the development phase and the utilisation phase, and at the user’s site.
            From an ICT company perspective and for each of these four main levers, it is best practice to:
                     —
                  keep on developing new solutions that offer opportunities to reduce environmental impacts (through R & D investments, partnerships with companies from other sectors, etc.);
                     —
                  help companies deploy such solutions into their operations and business (by specifically designing the solution according to its client needs, by providing training and communication, etc.);
                     —
                  internally deploy these solutions, if relevant.
            Applicability
            The BEMP is broadly applicable to all types of companies in this sector.
