            COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2022/1645
            of 14 July 2022
            laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as regards requirements for the management of information security risks with a potential impact on aviation safety for organisations covered by Commission Regulations (EU) No 748/2012 and (EU) No 139/2014 and amending Commission Regulations (EU) No 748/2012 and (EU) No 139/2014
         THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
            Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
            Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and amending Regulations (EC) No 2111/2005, (EC) No 1008/2008, (EU) No 996/2010, (EU) No 376/2014 and Directives 2014/30/EU and 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 552/2004 and (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 
            (, and in particular Articles 19(1) point (g) and 39(1) point (b) thereof.1)Whereas:
                        (1)
                     In accordance with the essential requirements set out in Annex II, point 3.1(b), to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, design and production organisations are to implement and maintain a management system to manage safety risks.
                        (2)
                     In addition, in accordance with the essential requirements set out in Annex VII, points 2.2.1 and 5.2, to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, aerodrome operators and organisations responsible for the provision of apron management services are to implement and maintain a management system to manage safety risks.
                        (3)
                     The safety risks referred to in recitals (1) and (2) may derive from different sources, including design and maintenance flaws, human performance aspects, environmental threats and information security threats. Therefore, the management systems implemented by the organisations as referred to in recitals (1) and (2), should take into account not only safety risks stemming from random events, but also safety risks deriving from information security threats where existing flaws may be exploited by individuals with a malicious intent. Those information security risks are constantly increasing in the civil aviation environment as the current information systems are becoming more and more interconnected, and increasingly becoming the target of malicious actors.
                        (4)
                     The risks associated with those information systems are not limited to possible attacks to the cyberspace, but encompass also threats which may affect processes and procedures as well as the performance of human beings.
                        (5)
                     A significant number of organisations already use international standards, such as ISO 27001, in order to address the security of digital information and data. These standards may not fully address all the specificities of civil aviation.
                        (6)
                     Therefore, it is appropriate to set out requirements for the management of information security risks with a potential impact on aviation safety.
                        (7)
                     It is essential that those requirements cover the different aviation domains and their interfaces since aviation is a highly interconnected system of systems. Therefore, they should apply to all the organisations that are already required to have a management system in accordance with the existing Union aviation safety legislation.
                        (8)
                     The requirements laid down in this Regulation should be consistently applied across all aviation domains, while creating a minimal impact on the Union aviation safety legislation already applicable to those domains.
                        (9)
                     The requirements laid down in this Regulation should be without prejudice to information security and cybersecurity requirements laid down in point 1.7 of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 
                        ( and in Article 14 of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2)(.3)
                        (10)
                     The definition on information security used for the purposes of this legal act should not be interpreted as divergent from the definition of security of network and information systems laid down in Directive (EU) 2016/1148.
                        (11)
                     In order to avoid duplication of legal requirements, where organisations covered by this Regulation are already subject to security requirements arising from other Union acts referred to in recital (9), which are, in their effect equivalent to the provisions laid down in this Regulation, compliance with those security requirements should be considered to constitute compliance with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.
                        (12)
                     Organisations covered by this Regulation that are already subject to security requirements arising from Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 should also comply with the requirements of Annex I (Part IS.D.OR.230 ‘Information security external reporting scheme’) to this Regulation as Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 does not contain any provisions related to external reporting of information security incidents.
                        (13)
                     Commission Regulations (EU) No 748/2012 
                        ( and (EU) No 139/2014 4)( should be amended in order to establish the link between the management systems prescribed in the regulations listed above and the information security management requirements prescribed by this Regulation.5)
                        (14)
                     In order to provide organisations with sufficient time to ensure compliance with the new rules and procedures introduced by this Regulation, this Regulation should apply from 3 years after the date of entry into force.
                        (15)
                     The requirements laid down by this Regulation are based on Opinion No 03/2021 
                        (, issued by the Agency in accordance with Article 75(2) points (b) and (c) and Article 76(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.6)
                        (16)
                     In accordance with Article 128(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, the Commission consulted experts designated by each Member State in accordance with the principles laid down in the Inter-institutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making
