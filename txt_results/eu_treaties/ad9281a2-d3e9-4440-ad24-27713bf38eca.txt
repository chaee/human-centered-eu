The Council and the Commission shall be responsible for ensuring such consistency and shall cooperate to this end. They shall ensure the implementation of these policies, each in accordance with its respective powers.</p><p></p><p>Article 4</p><p>The European Council shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political guidelines thereof.</p><p>The European Council shall bring together the Heads of State or Government of the Member States and the President of the Commission. They shall be assisted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Member States and by a Member of the Commission. The European Council shall meet at least twice a year, under the chairmanship of the Head of State or Government of the Member State which holds the Presidency of the Council.</p><p>The European Council shall submit to the European Parliament a report after each of its meetings and a yearly written report on the progress achieved by the Union.</p><p></p><p>Article 5</p><p>The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors shall exercise their powers under the conditions and for the purposes provided for, on the one hand, by the provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Communities and of the subsequent Treaties and Acts modifying and supplementing them and, on the other hand, by the other provisions of this Treaty.</p><p></p><p>Article 6</p><p>1. The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States.</p><p>2. The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.</p><p>3. The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States.</p><p>4. The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies.</p><p></p><p>Article 7 (2)</p><p>1. On a reasoned proposal by one third of the Member States, by the European Parliament or by the Commission, the Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the assent of the European Parliament, may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6(1), and address appropriate recommendations to that State. Before making such a determination, the Council shall hear the Member State in question and, acting in accordance with the same procedure, may call on independent persons to submit within a reasonable time limit a report on the situation in the Member State in question.</p><p>The Council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply.</p><p>2. The Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government and acting by unanimity on a proposal by one third of the Member States or by the Commission and after obtaining the assent of the European Parliament, may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6(1), after inviting the government of the Member State in question to submit its observations.</p><p>3.

In doing so, the Council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons.</p><p>The obligations of the Member State in question under this Treaty shall in any case continue to be binding on that State.</p><p>4.

For the purposes of this Article, the Council shall act without taking into account the vote of the representative of the government of the Member State in question. Abstentions by members present in person or represented shall not prevent the adoption of decisions referred to in paragraph 2.

For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, the European Parliament shall act by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, representing a majority of its Members.</p><p></p><p>TITLE II</p><p>PROVISIONS AMENDING THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY WITH A VIEW TO ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY</p><p>Article 8</p><p>(not reproduced)</p><p></p><p>TITLE III</p><p>PROVISIONS AMENDING THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY</p><p>Article 9</p><p>(not reproduced)</p><p></p><p>TITLE IV</p><p>PROVISIONS AMENDING THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY</p><p>Article 10</p><p>(not reproduced)</p><p></p><p>TITLE V</p><p>PROVISIONS ON A COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY</p><p>Article 11</p><p>1.

Decisions under this title shall be taken by the Council acting unanimously. Abstentions by members present in person or represented shall not prevent the adoption of such decisions.</p><p>When abstaining in a vote, any member of the Council may qualify its abstention by making a formal declaration under the present subparagraph. In that case, it shall not be obliged to apply the decision, but shall accept that the decision commits the Union. In a spirit of mutual solidarity, the Member State concerned shall refrain from any action likely to conflict with or impede Union action based on that decision and the other Member States shall respect its position. If the members of the Council qualifying their abstention in this way represent more than one third of the votes weighted in accordance with Article 205(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the decision shall not be adopted.</p><p>2.

The Council may, acting by a qualified majority, request that the matter be referred to the European Council for decision by unanimity.</p><p>The votes of the members of the Council shall be weighted in accordance with Article 205(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. For their adoption, decisions shall require at least 62 votes in favour, cast by at least 10 members(5).</p><p>This paragraph shall not apply to decisions having military or defence implications.</p><p>3. For procedural questions, the Council shall act by a majority of its members.</p><p></p><p>Article 24 (6)</p><p>1. When it is necessary to conclude an agreement with one or more States or international organisations in implementation of this title, the Council may authorise the Presidency, assisted by the Commission as appropriate, to open negotiations to that effect. Such agreements shall be concluded by the Council on a recommendation from the Presidency.</p><p>2. The Council shall act unanimously when the agreement covers an issue for which unanimity is required for the adoption of internal decisions.</p><p>3. When the agreement is envisaged in order to implement a joint action or common position, the Council shall act by a qualified majority in accordance with Article 23(2).</p><p>4. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to matters falling under Title VI. When the agreement covers an issue for which a qualified majority is required for the adoption of internal decisions or measures, the Council shall act by a qualified majority in accordance with Article 34(3).</p><p>5.

Agreements concluded under the conditions set out by this Article shall be binding on the institutions of the Union.</p><p></p><p>Article 25 (7)</p><p>Without prejudice to Article 207 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a Political and Security Committee shall monitor the international situation in the areas covered by the common foreign and security policy and contribute to the definition of policies by delivering opinions to the Council at the request of the Council or on its own initiative. It shall also monitor the implementation of agreed policies, without prejudice to the responsibility of the Presidency and the Commission.</p><p>Within the scope of this title, this Committee shall exercise, under the responsibility of the Council, political control and strategic direction of crisis management operations.</p><p>The Council may authorise the Committee, for the purpose and for the duration of a crisis management operation, as determined by the Council, to take the relevant decisions concerning the political control and strategic direction of the operation, without prejudice to Article 47.</p><p></p><p>Article 26</p><p>The Secretary-General of the Council, High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, shall assist the Council in matters coming within the scope of the common foreign and security policy, in particular through contributing to the formulation, preparation and implementation of policy decisions, and, when appropriate and acting on behalf of the Council at the request of the Presidency, through conducting political dialogue with third parties.</p><p></p><p>Article 27</p><p>The Commission shall be fully associated with the work carried out in the common foreign and security policy field.</p><p></p><p>Article 27a (8)</p><p>1.

The Commission shall give an opinion to the Council within three months of the date of receipt of that notification. Within four months of the date of receipt of that notification, the Council shall take a decision on the request and on such specific arrangements as it may deem necessary.
