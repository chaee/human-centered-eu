They shall ensure the implementation of these policies, each in accordance with its respective powers.</p><p>Article 4</p><p>The European Council shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political guidelines thereof.</p><p>The European Council shall bring together the Heads of State or Government of the Member States and the President of the Commission. They shall be assisted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Member States and by a Member of the Commission. The European Council shall meet at least twice a year, under the chairmanship of the Head of State or Government of the Member State which holds the Presidency of the Council.</p><p>The European Council shall submit to the European Parliament a report after each of its meetings and a yearly written report on the progress achieved by the Union.</p><p>Article 5</p><p>The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors shall exercise their powers under the conditions and for the purposes provided for, on the one hand, by the provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Communities and of the subsequent Treaties and Acts modifying and supplementing them and, on the other hand, by the other provisions of this Treaty.</p><p>Article 6</p><p>1. The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States.</p><p>2.

Before making such a determination, the Council shall hear the Member State in question and, acting in accordance with the same procedure, may call on independent persons to submit within a reasonable time limit a report on the situation in the Member State in question.</p><p>The Council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply.</p><p>2.

The Member State concerned shall inform the Council immediately of any such measures.</p><p>7.

Any Member State or the Commission may refer to the Council any question relating to the common foreign and security policy and may submit proposals to the Council.</p><p>2. In cases requiring a rapid decision, the Presidency, of its own motion, or at the request of the Commission or a Member State, shall convene an extraordinary Council meeting within 48 hours or, in an emergency, within a shorter period.</p><p>Article 23 [2]</p><p>1. Decisions under this title shall be taken by the Council acting unanimously. Abstentions by members present in person or represented shall not prevent the adoption of such decisions.</p><p>When abstaining in a vote, any member of the Council may qualify its abstention by making a formal declaration under the present subparagraph. In that case, it shall not be obliged to apply the decision, but shall accept that the decision commits the Union. In a spirit of mutual solidarity, the Member State concerned shall refrain from any action likely to conflict with or impede Union action based on that decision and the other Member States shall respect its position. If the members of the Council qualifying their abstention in this way represent more than one third of the votes weighted in accordance with Article 205(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the decision shall not be adopted.</p><p>2.

The Council may, acting by a qualified majority, request that the matter be referred to the European Council for decision by unanimity.</p><p>The votes of the members of the Council shall be weighted in accordance with Article 205(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. For their adoption, decisions shall require at least 232 votes in favour cast by at least two thirds of the members. When a decision is to be adopted by the Council by a qualified majority, a member of the Council may request verification that the Member States constituting the qualified majority represent at least 62% of the total population of the Union. If that condition is shown not to have been met, the decision in question shall not be adopted.</p><p>This paragraph shall not apply to decisions having military or defence implications.</p><p>3. For procedural questions, the Council shall act by a majority of its members.</p><p>Article 24</p><p>1. When it is necessary to conclude an agreement with one or more States or international organisations in implementation of this title, the Council may authorise the Presidency, assisted by the Commission as appropriate, to open negotiations to that effect. Such agreements shall be concluded by the Council on a recommendation from the Presidency.</p><p>2. The Council shall act unanimously when the agreement covers an issue for which unanimity is required for the adoption of internal decisions.</p><p>3. When the agreement is envisaged in order to implement a joint action or common position, the Council shall act by a qualified majority in accordance with Article 23(2).</p><p>4. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to matters falling under Title VI. When the agreement covers an issue for which a qualified majority is required for the adoption of internal decisions or measures, the Council shall act by a qualified majority in accordance with Article 34(3).</p><p>5. No agreement shall be binding on a Member State whose representative in the Council states that it has to comply with the requirements of its own constitutional procedure; the other members of the Council may agree that the agreement shall nevertheless apply provisionally.</p><p>6. Agreements concluded under the conditions set out by this Article shall be binding on the institutions of the Union.</p><p>Article 25</p><p>Without prejudice to Article 207 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a Political and Security Committee shall monitor the international situation in the areas covered by the common foreign and security policy and contribute to the definition of policies by delivering opinions to the Council at the request of the Council or on its own initiative. It shall also monitor the implementation of agreed policies, without prejudice to the responsibility of the Presidency and the Commission.</p><p>Within the scope of this title, this Committee shall exercise, under the responsibility of the Council, political control and strategic direction of crisis management operations.</p><p>The Council may authorise the Committee, for the purpose and for the duration of a crisis management operation, as determined by the Council, to take the relevant decisions concerning the political control and strategic direction of the operation, without prejudice to Article 47.</p><p>Article 26</p><p>The Secretary-General of the Council, High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, shall assist the Council in matters coming within the scope of the common foreign and security policy, in particular through contributing to the formulation, preparation and implementation of policy decisions, and, when appropriate and acting on behalf of the Council at the request of the Presidency, through conducting political dialogue with third parties.</p><p>Article 27</p><p>The Commission shall be fully associated with the work carried out in the common foreign and security policy field.</p><p>Article 27a</p><p>1. Enhanced cooperation in any of the areas referred to in this title shall be aimed at safeguarding the values and serving the interests of the Union as a whole by asserting its identity as a coherent force on the international scene. It shall respect:</p><p>- the principles, objectives, general guidelines and consistency of the common foreign and security policy and the decisions taken within the framework of that policy,</p><p>- the powers of the European Community, and</p><p>- consistency between all the Union's policies and its external activities.</p><p>2. Articles 11 to 27 and Articles 27b to 28 shall apply to the enhanced cooperation provided for in this Article, save as otherwise provided in Article 27c and Articles 43 to 45.</p><p>Article 27b</p><p>Enhanced cooperation pursuant to this title shall relate to implementation of a joint action or a common position. It shall not relate to matters having military or defence implications.</p><p>Article 27c</p><p>Member States which intend to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves under Article 27b shall address a request to the Council to that effect.</p><p>The request shall be forwarded to the Commission and, for information, to the European Parliament.
