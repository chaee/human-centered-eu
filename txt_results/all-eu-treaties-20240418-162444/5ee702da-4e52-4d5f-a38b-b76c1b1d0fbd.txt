Citizenship of the Union is hereby established.</p><p>Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union.</p><p>2.  Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights conferred by this Treaty and shall be subject to the duties imposed thereby.</p><p>  </p><p>Article 8a</p><p>1.  Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect.</p><p>2.  The Council may adopt provisions with a view to facilitating the exercise of the rights referred to in paragraph 1; save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, the Council shall act unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after obtaining the assent of the European Parliament.</p><p></p><p>Article 8b</p><p>1.  Every citizen of the Union residing in a Member State of which he is not a national shall have the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at municipal elections in the Member State in which he resides, under the same conditions as nationals of that State. This right shall be exercised subject to detailed arrangements to be adopted before 31 December 1994 by the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament; these arrangements may provide for derogations where warranted by problems specific to a Member State.</p><p>2.  Without prejudice to Article 138(3) and to the provisions adopted for its implementation, every citizen of the Union residing in a Member State of which he is not a national shall have the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament in the Member State in which he resides, under the same conditions as nationals of that State. This right shall be exercised subject to detailed arrangements to be adopted before 31 December 1993 by the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament; these arrangements may provide for derogations where warranted by problems specific to a Member State.</p><p></p><p>Article 8c</p><p>Every citizen of the Union shall, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of which he is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any Member State, on the same conditions as the nationals of that State. Before 31 December 1993, Member States shall establish the necessary rules among themselves and start the international negotiations required to secure this protection.</p><p></p><p>Article 8d</p><p>Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to petition the European Parliament in accordance with Article 138d.</p><p>Every citizen of the Union may apply to the Ombudsman established in accordance with Article 138e.</p><p></p><p>Article 8e</p><p>The Commission shall report to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Economic and Social Committee before 31 December 1993 and then every three years on the application of the provisions of this Part. This report shall take account of the development of the Union.</p><p>On this basis, and without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may adopt provisions to strengthen or to add to the rights laid down in this Part, which it shall recommend to the Member States for adoption in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</p><p>PART THREE (12*)</p><p>COMMUNITY POLICIES</p><p>TITLE I</p><p>FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS</p><p></p><p>Article 9</p><p>1.  The Community shall be based upon a customs union which shall cover all trade in goods and which shall involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties on imports and exports and of all charges having equivalent effect, and the adoption of a common customs tariff in their relations with third countries.</p><p>2. The provisions of Chapter 1, Section 1, and of Chapter 2 of this Title shall apply to products originating in Member States and to products coming from third countries which are in free circulation in Member States.</p><p>Article 10</p><p>1.  Products coming from a third country shall be considered to be in free circulation in a Member State if the import formalities have been complied with and any customs duties or charges having equivalent effect which are payable have been levied in that Member State, and if they have not benefited from a total or partial drawback of such duties or charges.</p><p>2.  The Commission shall, before the end of the first year after the entry into force of this Treaty, determine the methods of administrative cooperation to be adopted for the purpose of applying Article 9(2), taking into account the need to reduce as much as possible formalities imposed on trade.</p><p>Before the end of the first year after the entry into force of this Treaty, the Commission shall lay down the provisions applicable, as regards trade between Member States, to goods originating in another Member State in whose manufacture products have been used on which the exporting Member State has not levied the appropriate customs duties or charges having equivalent effect, or which have benefited from a total or partial drawback of such duties or charges.</p><p>In adopting these provisions, the Commission shall take into account the rules for the elimination of customs duties within the Community and for the progressive application of the common customs tariff.</p><p>Article 11</p><p>Member States shall take all appropriate measures to enable Governments to carry out, within the periods of time laid down, the obligations with regard to customs duties which devolve upon them pursuant to this Treaty.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>The Customs Union</p><p>Section 1</p><p>Elimination of customs duties between Member States</p><p></p><p>Article 12</p><p>Member States shall refrain from introducing between themselves any new customs duties on imports or exports or any charges having equivalent effect, and from increasing those which they already apply in their trade with each other.</p><p>Article 13</p><p>1.  Customs duties on imports in force between Member States shall be progressively abolished by them during the transitional period in accordance with Articles 14 and 15.</p><p>2.  Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports, in force between Member States, shall be progessively abolished by them during the transitional period. The Commission shall determine by means of directives the timetable for such abolition. It shall be guided by the rules contained in Article 14(2) and (3) and by the directives issued by the Council pursuant to Article 14(2).</p><p>Article 14</p><p>1.  For each product, the basic duty to which the successive reductions shall be applied shall be the duty applied on 1 January 1957.</p><p>2.  The timetable for the reductions shall be determined as follows:</p><p>(a)  during the first stage, the first reduction shall be made one year after the date when this Treaty enters into force; the second reduction, eighteen months later; the third reduction, at the end of the fourth year after the date when this Treaty enters into force;</p><p>(b) during the second stage, a reduction shall be made eighteen months after that stage begins; a second reduction, eighteen months after the preceding one; a third reduction, one year later;</p><p>(c) any remaining reductions shall be made during the third stage; the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, determine the timetable therefor by means of directives.</p><p>3.  At the time of the first reduction, Member States shall introduce between themselves a duty on each product equal to the basic duty minus 10 %.</p><p>At the time of each subsequent reduction, each Member State shall reduce its customs duties as a whole in such manner as to lower by 10 % its total customs receipts as defined in paragraph 4 and to reduce the duty on each product by at least 5 % of the basic duty.</p><p>In the case, however, of products on which the duty is still in excess of 30 %, each reduction must be at least 10 % of the basic duty.</p><p>4.  The total customs receipts of each Member State, as referred to in paragraph 3, shall be calculated by multiplying the value of its imports from other Member States during 1956 by the basic duties.</p><p>5.  Any special problems raised in applying paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be settled by directives issued by the Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission.</p><p>6.  Member States shall report to the Commission on the manner in which effect has been given to the preceding rules for the reduction of duties. They shall endeavour to ensure that the reduction made in the duties on each product shall amount:</p><p>-  at the end of the first stage, to at least 25 % of the basic duty;</p><p>- at the end of the second stage, to at least 50 % of the basic duty.</p><p>If the Commission finds that there is a risk that the objectives laid down in Article 13, and the percentages laid down in this paragraph, cannot be attained, it shall make all appropriate recommendations to Member States.</p><p>7.  The provisions of this Article may be amended by the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament.</p><p>Article 15</p><p>1.  Irrespective of the provisions of Article 14, any Member State may, in the course of the transitional period, suspend in whole or in part the collection of duties applied by it to products imported from other Member States. It shall inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof.</p><p>2.  The Member States declare their readiness to reduce customs duties against the other Member States more rapidly than is provided for in Article 14 if their general economic situation and the situation of the economic sector concerned so permit.</p><p>To this end, the Commission shall make recommendations to the Member States concerned.</p><p>Article 16</p><p>Member States shall abolish between themselves customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect by the end of the first stage at the latest.</p><p>Article 17</p><p>1.  The provisions of Articles 9 to 15(1) shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. Such duties shall not, however, be taken into consideration for the purpose of calculating either total customs receipts or the reduction of customs duties as a whole as referred to in Article 14(3) and (4).</p><p>Such duties shall, at each reduction, be lowered by not less than 10 % of the basic duty. Member States may reduce such duties more rapidly than is provided for in Article 14.</p><p>2.  Member States shall, before the end of the first year after the entry into force of this Treaty, inform the Commission of their customs duties of a fiscal nature.</p><p>3.  Member States shall retain the right to substitute for these duties an internal tax which complies with the provisions of Article 95.</p><p>4.  If the Commission finds that substitution for any customs duty of a fiscal nature meets with serious difficulties in a Member State, it shall authorize that State to retain the duty on condition that it shall abolish it not later than six years after the entry into force of this Treaty. Such authorization must be applied for before the end of the first year after the entry into force of this Treaty.</p><p>Section 2</p><p>Setting up of the common customs tariff</p><p></p><p>Article 18</p><p>The Member States declare their readiness to contribute to the development of international trade and the lowering of barriers to trade by entering into agreements designed, on a basis of reciprocity and mutual advantage, to reduce customs duties below the general level of which they could avail themselves as a result of the establishment of a customs union between them.</p><p>Article 19</p><p>1.  Subject to the conditions and within the limits provided for hereinafter, duties in the common customs tariff shall be at the level of the arithmetical average of the duties applied in the four customs territories comprised in the Community.</p><p>2.  The duties taken as the basis for calculating this average shall be those applied by Member States on 1 January 1957.</p><p>In the case of the Italian tariff, however, the duty applied shall be that without the temporary 10 % reduction. Furthermore, with respect to items on which the Italian tariff contains a conventional duty, this duty shall be substituted for the duty applied as defined above, provided that it does not exceed the latter by more than 10 %. Where the conventional duty exceeds the duty applied as defined above by more than 10 %, the latter duty plus 10 % shall be taken as the basis for calculating the arithmetical average.</p><p>With regard to the tariff headings in List A, the duties shown in that List shall, for the purpose of calculating the arithmetical average, be substituted for the duties applied.</p><p>3.  The duties in the common customs tariff shall not exceed:</p><p>(a)  3 % for products within the tariff headings in List B;</p><p>(b) 10 % for products within the tariff headings in List C;</p><p>(c) 15 % for products within the tariff headings in List D;</p><p>(d) 25 % for products within the tariff headings in List E; where in respect of such products, the tariff of the Benelux countries contains a duty not exceeding 3 %, such duty shall, for the purpose of calculating the arithmetical average, be raised to 12 %.</p><p>4.  List F prescribes the duties applicable to the products listed therein.</p><p>5.  The Lists of tariff headings referred to in this Article and in Article 20 are set out in Annex I to this Treaty.</p><p>Article 20</p><p>The duties applicable to the products in List G shall be determined by negotiation between the Member States. Each Member State may add further products to this List to a value not exceeding 2 % of the total value of its imports from third countries in the course of the year 1956.</p><p>The Commission shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that such negotiations shall be undertaken before the end of the second year after the entry into force of this Treaty and be concluded before the end of the first stage.</p><p>If, for certain products, no agreement can be reached within these periods, the Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission, acting unanimously until the end of the second stage and by a qualified majority thereafter, determine the duties in the common customs tariff.</p><p>Article 21</p><p>1.  Technical difficulties which may arise in applying Articles 19 and 20 shall be resolved, within two years of the entry into force of this Treaty, by directives issued by the Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission.</p><p>2.  Before the end of the first stage, or at latest when the duties are determined, the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, decide on any adjustments required in the interests of the internal consistency of the common customs tariff as a result of applying the rules set out in Articles 19 and 20, taking account in particular of the degree of processing undergone by the various goods to which the common tariff applies.</p><p>Article 22</p><p>The Commission shall, within two years of the entry into force of this Treaty, determine the extent to which the customs duties of a fiscal nature referred to in Article 17(2) shall be taken into account in calculating the arithmetical average provided for in Article 19(1). The Commission shall take account of any protective character which such duties may have.</p><p>Within six months of such determination, any Member State may request that the procedure provided for in  Article 20 should be applied to the product in question, but in this event the percentage limit provided in that Article shall not be applicable to that State.</p><p>Article 23</p><p>1.  For the purpose of the progressive introduction of the common customs tariff, Member States shall amend their tariffs applicable to third countries as follows:</p><p>(a)  in the case of tariff headings on which the duties applied in practice on 1 January 1957 do not differ by more than 15 % in either direction from the duties in the common customs tariff, the latter duties shall be applied at the end of the fourth year after the entry into force of this Treaty;</p><p>(b) in any other case, each Member State shall, as from the same date, apply a duty reducing by 30 % the difference between the duty applied in practice on 1 January 1957 and the duty in the common customs tariff;</p><p>(c) at the end of the second stage this difference shall again be reduced by 30 %;</p><p>(d) in the case of tariff headings for which the duties in the common customs tariff are not yet available at the end of the first stage, each Member State shall, within six months of the Council&#039;s action in accordance with Article 20, apply such duties as would result from application of the rules contained in this paragraph.</p><p>2.  Where a Member State has been granted an authorization under Article 17(4), it need not, for as long as that authorization remains valid, apply the preceding provisions to the tariff headings to which the authorization applies. When such authorization expires, the Member State concerned shall apply such duty as would have resulted from application of the rules contained in paragraph 1.</p><p>3.  The common customs tariff shall be applied in its entirety by the end of the transitional period at the latest.</p><p>Article 24</p><p>Member States shall remain free to change their duties more rapidly than is provided for in Article 23 in order to bring them into line with the common customs tariff.</p><p>Article 25</p><p>1.  If the Commission finds that the production in Member States of particular products contained in Lists B, C and D is insufficient to supply the demands of one of the Member States, and that such supply traditionally depends to a considerable extent on imports from third countries, the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, grant the Member State concerned tariff quotas at a reduced rate of duty or duty free.</p><p>Such quotas may not exceed the limits beyond which the risk might arise of activities being transferred to the detriment of other Member States.</p><p>2.  In the case of the products in List E, and of those in List G for which the rates of duty have been determined in accordance with the procedure provided for in the third paragraph of Article 20, the Commission shall, where a change in sources of supply or shortage of supplies within the Community is such as to entail harmful consequences for the processing industries of a Member State, at the request of that Member State, grant it tariff quotas at a reduced rate of duty or duty free.</p><p>Such quotas may not exceed the limits beyond which the risk might arise of activities being transferred to the detriment of other Member States.</p><p>3.  In the case of the products listed in Annex II to this Treaty, the Commission may authorize any Member State to suspend, in whole or in part, collection of the duties applicable or may grant such Member State tariff quotas at a reduced rate of duty or duty free, provided that no serious disturbance of the market of the products concerned results therefrom.</p><p>4.  The Commission shall periodically examine tariff quotas granted pursuant to this Article.</p><p>Article 26</p><p>The Commission may authorize any Member State encountering special difficulties to postpone the lowering or raising of duties provided for in Article 23 in respect of particular headings in its tariff.</p><p>Such authorization may only be granted for a limited period and in respect of tariff headings which, taken together, represent for such State not more than 5 % of the value of its imports from third countries in the course of the latest year for which statistical data are available.</p><p>Article 27</p><p>Before the end of the first stage, Member States shall, in so far as may be necessary, take steps to approximate their provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of customs matters. To this end, the Commission shall make all appropriate recommendations to Member States.</p><p>Article 28</p><p>Any autonomous alteration or suspension of duties in the common customs tariff shall be decided by the Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission.</p><p></p><p>Article 29</p><p>In carrying out the tasks entrusted to it under this Section the Commission shall be guided by:</p><p>(a)  the need to promote trade between Member States and third countries;</p><p>(b) developments in conditions of competition within the Community in so far as they lead to an improvement in the competitive capacity of undertakings;</p><p>(c) the requirements of the Community as regards the supply of raw materials and semi-finished goods; in this connection the Commission shall take care to avoid distorting conditions of competition between Member States in respect of finished goods;</p><p>(d) the need to avoid serious disturbances in the economies of Member States and to ensure rational development of production and an expansion of consumption within the Community.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Elimination of quantitative restrictions between Member States</p><p></p><p>Article 30</p><p>Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall, without prejudice to the following provisions, be prohibited between Member States.</p><p></p><p>Article 31</p><p>Member States shall refrain from introducing between themselves any new quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect.</p><p>This obligation shall, however, relate only to the degree of liberalization attained in pursuance of the decisions of the Council of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation of 14 January 1955. Member States shall supply the Commission, not later than six months after the entry into force of this Treaty, with lists of the products liberalized by them in pursuance of these decisions. These lists shall be consolidated between Member States.</p><p>Article 32</p><p>In their trade with one another Member States shall refrain from making more restrictive the quotas and measures having equivalent effect existing at the date of the entry into force of this Treaty.</p><p>  These quotas shall be abolished by the end of the transitional period at the latest. During that period, they shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the following provisions.</p><p>Article 33</p><p>1.  One year after the entry into force of this Treaty, each Member State shall convert any bilateral quotas open to any other Member States into global quotas open without discrimination to all other Member States.</p><p>On the same date, Member States shall increase the aggregate of the global quotas so established in such a manner as to bring about an increase of not less than 20 % in their total value as compared with the preceding year. The global quota for each product, however, shall be increased by not less than 10 %.</p><p>The quotas shall be increased annually in accordance with the same rules and in the same proportions in relation to the preceding year.</p><p>The fourth increase shall take place at the end of the fourth year after the entry into force of this Treaty; the fifth, one year after the beginning of the second stage.</p><p>2.  Where, in the case of a product which has not been liberalized, the global quota does not amount to 3 % of the national production of the State concerned, a quota equal to not less than 3 % of such national production shall be introduced not later than one year after the entry into force of this Treaty. This quota shall be raised to 4 % at the end of the second year, and to 5 %  at the end of the third. Thereafter, the Member State concerned shall increase the quota by not less than 15 % annually.</p><p>Where there is no such national production, the Commission shall take a decision establishing an appropriate quota.</p><p>3.  At the end of the tenth year, each quota shall be equal to not less than 20 % of the national production.</p><p>4.  If the Commission finds by means of a decision that during two successive years the imports of any product have been below the level of the quota opened, this global quota shall not be taken into account in calculating the total value of the global quotas. In such case, the Member State shall abolish quota restrictions on the product concerned.</p><p>5.  In the case of quotas representing more than 20 % of the national production of the product concerned, the Council may, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, reduce the minimum percentage of 10 % laid down in paragraph 1. This alteration shall not, however, affect the obligation to increase the total value of global quotas by 20 % annually.</p><p>6.  Member States which have exceeded their obligations as regards the degree of liberalization attained in pursuance of the decisions of the Council of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation of 14 January 1955 shall be entitled, when calculating the annual total increase of 20 % provided for in paragraph 1, to take into account the amount of imports liberalized by autonomous action. Such calculation shall be submitted to the Commission for its prior approval.</p><p>7.  The Commission shall issue directives establishing the procedure and timetable in accordance with which Member States shall abolish, as between themselves, any measures in existence when this Treaty enters into force which have an effect equivalent to quotas.</p><p>8.  If the Commission finds that the application of the provisions of this Article, and in particular of the provisions concerning percentages, makes it impossible to ensure that the abolition of quotas provided for in the second paragraph of Article 32 is carried out progressively, the Council may, on a proposal from the Commission, acting unanimously during the first stage and by a qualified majority thereafter, amend the procedure laid down in this Article and may, in particular, increase the percentages fixed.</p><p>Article 34</p><p>1.  Quantitative restrictions on exports, and all measures having equivalent effect, shall be prohibited between Member States.</p><p>2.  Member States shall, by the end of the first stage at the latest, abolish all quantitative restrictions on exports and any measures having equivalent effect which are in existence when this Treaty enters into force.</p><p>Article 35</p><p>The Member States declare their readiness to abolish quantitative restrictions on imports from and exports to other Member States more rapidly than is provided for in the preceding Articles, if their general economic situation and the situation of the economic sector concerned so permit.</p><p>To this end, the Commission shall make recommendations to the Member States concerned.</p><p>Article 36</p><p>The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.</p><p>Article 37</p><p>1.  Member States shall progressively adjust any State monopolies of a commercial character so as to ensure that when the transitional period has ended no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of Member States.</p><p>The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which a Member State, in law or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervises, determines or appreciably influences imports or exports between Member States. These provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated by the State to others.</p><p>2.  Member States shall refrain from introducing any new measure which is contrary to the principles laid down in paragraph 1 or which restricts the scope of the Articles dealing with the abolition of customs duties and quantitative restrictions between Member States.</p><p>3.  The timetable for the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be harmonized with the abolition of quantitative restrictions on the same products provided for in Articles 30 to 34.</p><p>If a product is subject to a State monopoly of a commercial character in only one or some Member States, the Commission may authorize the other Member States to apply protective measures until the adjustment provided for in paragraph 1 has been effected; the Commission shall determine the conditions and details of such measures.</p><p>4.  If a State monopoly of a commercial character has rules which are designed to make it easier to dispose of agricultural products or obtain for them the best return, steps should be taken in applying the rules contained in this Article to ensure equivalent safeguards for the employment and standard of living of the producers concerned, account being taken of the adjustments that will be possible and the specialization that will be needed with the passage of time.</p><p>5.  The obligations on Member States shall be binding only in so far as they are compatible with existing international agreements.</p><p>6.  With effect from the first stage the Commission shall make recommendations as to the manner in which and the timetable according to which the adjustment provided for in this Article shall be carried out.</p><p>TITLE II</p><p>AGRICULTURE</p><p></p><p>Article 38</p><p>1.  The common market shall extend to agriculture and trade in agricultural products. &#039;Agricultural products`  means the products of the soil, of stockfarming and of fisheries and products of first-stage processing directly related to these products.</p><p>2.  Save as otherwise provided in Articles 39 to 46, the rules laid down for the establishment of the common market shall apply to agricultural products.</p><p>3.  The products subject to the provisions of Articles 39 to 46 are listed in Annex II to this Treaty. Within two years of the entry into force of this Treaty, however, the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, decide what products are to be added to this list.</p><p>4.  The operation and development of the common market for agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy among the Member States.</p><p>Article 39</p><p>1.  The objectives of the common agricultural policy shall be:</p><p>(a)  to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilization of the factors of production, in particular labour;</p><p>(b)  thus to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture;</p><p>(c)  to stabilize markets;</p><p>(d)  to assure the availability of supplies;</p><p>(e)  to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.</p><p>2.  In working out the common agricultural policy and the special methods for its application, account shall be taken of:</p><p>(a)  the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions;</p><p>(b)  the need to effect the appropriate adjustments by degrees;</p><p>(c)  the fact that in the Member States agriculture constitutes a sector closely linked with the economy as a whole.</p><p>Article 40</p><p>1.  Member States shall develop the common agricultural policy by degrees during the transitional period and shall bring it into force by the end of that period at the latest.</p><p>2.  In order to attain the objectives set out in Article 39a common organization of agricultural markets shall be established.</p><p>This organization shall take one of the following forms, depending on the product concerned:</p><p>(a)  common rules on competition;</p><p>(b)  compulsory coordination of the various national market organizations;</p><p>(c)  a European market organization.</p><p>3.  The common organization established in accordance with paragraph 2 may include all measures required to attain the objectives set out in Article 39, in particular regulation of prices, aids for the production and marketing of the various products, storage and carryover arrangements and common machinery for stabilizing imports or exports.</p><p>The common organization shall be limited to pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 39 and shall exclude any discrimination between producers or consumers withing the Community.</p><p>Any common price policy shall be based on common criteria and uniform methods of calculation.</p><p>4.  In order to enable the common organization referred to in paragraph 2 to attain its objectives, one or more agricultural guidance and guarantee funds may be set up.</p><p>Article 41</p><p>To enable the objectives set out in Article 39 to be attained, provision may be made within the framework of the common agricultural policy for measures such as:</p><p>(a)  an effective coordination of efforts in the spheres of vocational training, of research and of the dissemination of agricultural knowledge; this may include joint financing of projects or institutions;</p><p>(b)  joint measures to promote consumption of certain products.</p><p>Article 42</p><p>The provisions of the Chapter relating to rules on competition shall apply to production of and trade in agricultural products only to the extent determined by the Council within the framework of Article 43(2) and  (3) and in accordance with the procedure laid down therein, account being taken of the objectives set out in Article 39.</p><p>The Council may, in particular, authorize the granting of aid:</p><p>(a)  for the protection of enterprises handicapped by structural or natural conditions;</p><p>(b)  within the framework of economic development programmes.</p><p>Article 43</p><p>1.  In order to evolve the broad lines of a common agricultural policy, the Commission shall, immediately this Treaty enters into force, convene a conference of the Member States with a view to making a comparison of their agricultural policies, in particular by producing a statement of their resoucres and needs.</p><p>2.  Having taken into account the work of the conference provided for in paragraph 1, after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and within two years of the entry into force of this Treaty, the Commission shall submit proposals for working out and implementing the common agricultural policy, including the replacement of the national organizations by one of the forms of common organization provided for in Article 40(2), and for implementing the measures specified in this Title.</p><p>These proposals shall take account of the interdependence of the agricultural matters mentioned in this Title.</p><p>The Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, acting unanimously during the first two stages and by a qualified majority thereafter, make regulations, issue directives, or take decisions, without prejudice to any recommendations it may also make.</p><p>3.  The Council may, acting by a qualified majority and in accordance with paragraph 2, replace the national market organizations by the common organization provided for in Article 40(2) if:</p><p>(a)  the common organization offers Member States which are opposed to this measure and which have an organization of their own for the production in question equivalent safeguards for the employment and standard of living of the producers concerned, account being taken of the adjustments that will be possible and the specialization that will be needed with the passage of time;</p><p>(b)  such an organization ensures conditions for trade within the Community similar to those existing in a national market.</p><p>4.  If a common organization for certain raw materials is established before a common organization exists for the corresponding processed products, such raw materials as are used for processed products intended for export to third countries may be imported from outside the Community.</p><p>Article 44</p><p>1.  In so far as progressive abolition of customs duties and quantitative restrictions between Member States may result in prices likely to jeopardize the attainment of the objectives set out in Article 39, each Member State shall, during the transitional period, be entitled to apply to particular products, in a non-discriminatory manner and in substitution for quotas and to such an extent as shall not impede the expansion of the volume of trade provided for in Article 45(2), a system of minimum prices below which imports may be either:</p><p>-  temporarily suspended or reduced; or</p><p>-  allowed, but subjected to the condition that they are made at a price higher than the minimum price for the product concerned.</p><p>In the latter case the minimum prices shall not include customs duties.</p><p>2.  Minimum prices shall neither cause a reduction of the trade existing between Member States when this Treaty enters into force nor form an obstacle to progressive expansion of this trade. Minimum prices shall not be applied so as to form an obstacle to the development of a natural preference between Member States.</p><p>3.  As soon as this Treaty enters into force the Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission, determine objective criteria for the establishment of minimum price systems and for the fixing of such prices.</p><p>These criteria shall in particular take account of the average national production costs in the Member State applying the minimum price, of the position of the various undertakings concerned in relation to such average production costs, and of the need to promote both the progressive improvement of agricultural practice and the adjustments and specialization needed within the common market.</p><p>The Commission shall further propose a procedure for revising these criteria in order to allow for and speed up technical progress and to approximate prices progressively within the common market.</p><p>These criteria and the procedure for revising them shall be determined by the Council acting unanimously within three years of the entry into force of this Treaty.</p><p>4.  Until the decision of the Council takes effect, Member States may fix minimum prices on condition that these are communicated beforehand to the Commission and to the other Member States so that they may submit their comments.</p><p>Once the Council has taken its decision. Member States shall fix minimum prices on the basis of the criteria determined as above.</p><p>The Council may, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, rectify any decisions taken by Member States which do not conform to the criteria defined above.</p><p>5.  If it does not prove possible to determine the said objective criteria for certain products by the beginning of the third stage, the Council may, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, vary the minimum prices applied to these products.</p><p>6.  At the end of the transitional period, a table of minimum prices still in force shall be drawn up. The Council shall, acting on a proposal from the Commission and by a majority of nine votes in accordance with the weighting laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 148(2), determine the system to be applied within the framework of the common agricultural policy.</p><p>Article 45</p><p>1.  Until national market organizations have been replaced by one of the forms of common organization referred to in Article 40(2), trade in products in respect of which certain Member States:</p><p>-  have arrangements designed to guarantee national producers a market for their products; and</p><p>-  are in need of imports,</p><p>shall be developed by the conclusion of long-term agreements or contracts between importing and exporting Member States.</p><p>These agreements or contracts shall be directed towards the progressive abolition of any discrimination in the application of these arrangements of the various producers within the Community.</p><p>Such agreements or contracts shall be concluded during the first stage; account shall be taken of the principle or reciprocity.</p><p>2.  As regards quantities, these agreements or contracts shall be based on the average volume of trade between Member States in the products concerned during the three years before the entry into force of this Treaty and shall provide for an increase in the volume of trade within the limits of existing requirements, account being taken of traditional patterns of trade.</p><p>As regards prices, these agreements or contracts shall enable producers to dispose of the agreed quantities at prices which shall be progressively approximated to those paid to national producers on the domestic market of the purchasing country.</p><p>This approximation shall proceed as steadily as possible and shall be completed by the end of the transitional period at the latest.</p><p>Prices shall be negotiated between the parties concerned within the framework of directives issued by the Commission for the purpose of implementing the two preceding subparagraphs.</p><p>If the first stage is extended, these agreements or contracts shall continue to be carried out in accordance with the conditions applicable at the end of the fourth year after the entry into force of this Treaty, the obligation to increase quantities and to approximate prices being suspended until the transition to the second stage.</p><p>Member States shall avail themselves of any opportunity open to them under their legislation, particularly in respect of import policy, to ensure the conclusion and carrying out of these agreements or contracts.</p><p>3.  To the extent that Member States require raw materials for the manufacture of products to be exported outside the Community in competition with products of third countries, the above agreements or contracts shall not form an obstacle to the importation of raw materials for this purpose form third countries. This provision shall not, however, apply if the Council unanimously decides to make provision for payments required to compensate for the higher price paid on goods imported for this purpose on the basis of these agreements or contracts in relation to the delivered price of the same goods purchased on the world market.</p><p>Article 46</p><p>Where in a Member State a product is subject to a national market organization or to internal rules having equivalent effect which affect the competitive position of similar production in another Member State, a countervailing charge shall be applied by Member States to imports of this product coming from the Member State where such organization or rules exist, unless that State applies a countervailing charge on export.</p><p>The Commission shall fix the amount of these charges at the level required to redress the balance; it may also authorize other measures, the conditions and details of which it shall determine.</p><p>Article 47</p><p>As to the functions to be performed by the Economic and Social Committee in pursuance of this Title, its agricultural section shall hold itself at the disposal of the Commission to prepare, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 197 and 198, the deliberations of the Committee.</p><p>TITLE III</p><p>FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS, SERVICES AND</p><p>CAPITAL</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Workers</p><p></p><p>Article 48</p><p>1.  Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Community by the end of the transitional period at the latest.</p><p>2.  Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment.</p><p>3.  It shall entail the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health:</p><p>(a)  to accept offers of employment actually made;</p><p>  (b)  to move freely within the territory of Member States for this purpose;</p><p>(c)  to stay in a Member State for the purpose of employment in accordance with the provisions governing the employment of nationals of that State laid down by law, regulation or administrative action;</p><p>(d)  to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State, subject to conditions which shall be embobied in implementing regulations to be drawn up by the Commission.</p><p>4.  The provisions of this Article shall not apply to employment in the public service.</p><p>Article 49</p><p>As soon as this Treaty enters into force, the Council shall, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, issue directives or make regulations setting out the measures required to bring about, by progressive stages, freedom of movement for workers, as defined in Article 48, in particular (13*):</p><p>(a)  by ensuring close cooperation between national employment services;</p><p>(b)  by systematically and progressively abolishing those administrative procedures and practices and those qualifying periods in respect of eligibility for available employment, whether resulting from national legislation or from agreements previously concluded between Member States, the maintenance of which would from an obstacle to liberalization of the movement of workers;</p><p>(c)  by systematically and progressively abolishing all such qualifying periods and other restrictions provided for either under national legislation or under agreements previously concluded between Member States as imposed on workers of other Member States conditions regarding the free choice of employment other than those imposed on workers of the State concerned;</p><p>(d)  by setting up appropriate machinery to bring offers of employment into touch with applications for employment and to facilitate the achievement of a balance between supply and demand in the employment market in such a way as to avoid serious threats to the standard of living and level of employment in the various regions and industries.</p><p></p><p>Article 50</p><p>Member States shall, within the framework of a joint programme, encourage the exchange of young workers.</p><p>Article 51</p><p>The Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, adopt such measures in the field of social security as are necessary to provide freedom of movement for workers; to this end, it shall make arrangements to secure for migrant workers and their dependants:</p><p>(a)  aggregation, for the purpose of acquiring and retaining the right to benefit and of calculating the amount of benefit, of all periods taken into account under the laws of the several countries;</p><p>(b)  payment of benefits to person resident in the territories of Member States.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Right of establishment</p><p></p><p>Article 52</p><p>Within the framework of the provisions set out below, restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State shall be abolished by progressive stages in the course of the transitional period. Such progressive abolition shall also apply to restrictions on the setting up of agencies, branches or subsidiaries by nationals of any Member State established in the territory of any Member State.</p><p>Freedom of establishment shall include the right to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons and to set up and manage undertakings, in particular companies or firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58, under the conditions laid down for its own nationals by the law of the country where such establishment is effected, subject to the provisions of the Chapter relating to capital.</p><p>Article 53</p><p>Member States shall not introduce any new restrictions on the right of establishment in their territories of nationals of other Member States, save as otherwise provided in this Treaty.</p><p>Article 54</p><p>1.  Before the end of the first stage, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the European Parliament, draw up a general programme for the abolition of existing restrictions on freedom of establishment within the Community. The Commission shall submit its proposal to the Council during the first two years of the first stage.</p><p>The programme shall set out the general conditions under which freedom of establishment is to be attained in the case of each type of activity and in particular the stages by which it is to be attained.</p><p>2.  In order to implement this general programme or, in the absence of such programme, in order to achieve a stage in attaining freedom of establishment as regards a particular activity, the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, shall act by means of directives.

For the same purpose, the Council shall, before the end of the transitional period, issue directives for the coordination of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the taking up and pursuit of activities as self-employed persons. The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, shall decide on directives the implementation of which involves in at least one Member State amendment of the existing principles laid down by law governing the professions with respect to training and conditions of access for natural persons.

In this event the Commission may, after consulting the Monetary Committee, decide that the State concerned shall amend or abolish the measures.</p><p></p><p>Article 73a (18*)</p><p>As from 1 January 1994, Articles 67 to 73 shall be replaced by Articles 73b, c, d, e, f and g.</p><p></p><p>Article 73b (19*)</p><p>1.

The provisions of Article 73b shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States:</p><p>(a)  to apply the relevant provisions of their tax law which distinguish between tax-payers who are not in the same situation with regard to their place of residence or with regard to the place where their capital is invested;</p><p>  (b)  to take all requisite measures to prevent infringements of national law and regulations, in particular in the field of taxation and the prudential supervison of financial institutions, or to lay down procedures for the declaration of capital movements for purposes of administrative or statistical information, or to take measures which are justified on grounds of public policy or public security.</p><p>2.  The provisions of this Chapter shall be without prejudice to the applicability of restrictions on the right of establishment which are compatible with this Treaty.</p><p>3.

Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market.</p><p>2.  The following shall be compatible with the common market:</p><p>(a)  aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers, provided that such aid is granted without discrimination related to the origin of the products concerned;</p><p>(b)  aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences;</p><p>(c)  aid granted to the economy of certain areas of the Federal Republic of Germany affected by the division of Germany, in so far as such aid is required in order to compensate for the economic disadvantages caused by that division.</p><p>3.

However, the aids granted to shipbuilding as of 1 January 1957 shall, in so far as they serve only to compensate for the absence of customs protection, be progressively reduced under the same conditions as apply to the elimination of customs duties, subject to the provisions of this Treaty concerning common commercial policy towards third countries;</p><p>(d) aid to promote culture and heritage conservation where such aid does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent that is contrary to the common interest (28*);</p><p>(e) such other categories of aid as may be specified by decision of the Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission.</p><p>Article 93</p><p>1.  The Commission shall, in cooperation with Member States, keep under constant review all systems of aid existing in those States. It shall propose to the latter any appropriate measures required by the progressive development or by the functioning of the common market.</p><p>2.  If, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds that aid granted by a State or through State resources is not compatible with the common market having regard to Article 92, or that such aid is being misused, it shall decide that the State concerned shall abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission.</p><p>If the State concerned does not comply with this decision within the prescribed time, the Commission or any other interested State may, in derogation from the provisions of Articles 169 and 170, refer the matter to the Court of Justice direct.</p><p>On application by a Member State, the Council, may, acting unanimously, decide that aid which that State is granting or intends to grant shall be considered to be compatible with the common market, in derogation from the provisions of Article 92 or from the regulations provided for in Article 94, if such a decision is justified by exceptional circumstances. If, as regards the aid in question, the Commission has already initiated the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the fact that the State concerned has made its application to the Council shall have the effect of suspending that procedure until the Council has made its attitude known.</p><p>If, however, the Council has not made its attitude known within three months of the said application being made, the Commission shall give its decision on the case.</p><p>3.

Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments either as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its balance of payments, or as a result of the type of currency at its disposal, and where such difficulties are liable in particular to jeopardize the functioning of the common market or the progressive implementation of the common commercial policy, the Commission shall immediately investigate the position of the State in question and the action which, making use of all the means at its disposal, that State has taken or may take in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty. The Commission shall state what measures it recommends the State concerned to take.</p><p>If the action taken by a Member State and the measures suggested by the Commission do not prove sufficient to overcome the difficulties which have arisen or which threaten, the Commission shall, after consulting the Committee referred to in Article 109c, recommend to the Council the granting of mutual assistance and appropriate methods therefor.</p><p>The Commission shall keep the Council regularly informed of the situation and of how it is developing.</p><p>2.

Such measures must cause the least possible disturbance in the functioning of the common market and must not be wider in scope than is strictly necessary to remedy the sudden difficulties which have arisen.</p><p>2.  The Commission and the other Member States shall be informed of such protective measures not later than when they enter into force. The Commission may recommend to the Council the granting of mutual assistance under Article 109h.</p><p>3.  After the Commission has delivered an opinion and the Committee referred to in Article 109c has been consulted, the Council may, acting by a qualified majority, decide that the State concerned shall amend, suspend or abolish the protective measures referred to above.</p><p>4.  Subject to Article 109k(6), this Article shall cease to apply from the beginning of the third stage.</p><p>Article 109j</p><p>1.  The Commission and the EMI shall report to the Council on the progress made in the fulfilment by the Member States of their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union. These reports shall include an examination of the compatibility between each Member State&#039;s national legislation, including the statutes of its national central bank, and Articles 107 and 108 of this Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. The reports shall also examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of the following criteria:</p><p>-  the achievement of a high degree of price stability; this will be apparent from a rate of inflation which is close to that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability;</p><p>- the sustainability of the government financial position; this will be apparent from having achieved a government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive as determined in accordance with Article 104c(6);</p><p>- the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System, for at least two years, without devaluing against the currency of any other Member State;</p><p>- the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State and of its participation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System being reflected in the long-term interest rate levels.</p><p>The four criteria mentioned in this paragraph and the relevant periods over which they are to be respected are developed further in a Protocol annexed to this Treaty. The reports of the Commission and the EMI shall also take account of the development of the ECU, the results of the integration of markets, the situation and development of the balances of payments on current account and an examination of the development of unit labour costs and other price indices.</p><p>2.  On the basis of these reports, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission, shall assess:</p><p>-  for each Member State, whether it fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency;</p><p>- whether a majority of the Member States fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency,</p><p>and recommend its findings to the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or of Government. The European Parliament shall be consulted and forward its opinion to the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or of Government.</p><p>3.  Taking due account of the reports referred to in paragraph 1 and the opinion of the European Parliament referred to in paragraph 2, the Council, meeting in the composition of Heads of State or of Government, shall, acting by a qualified majority, not later than 31 December 1996:</p><p>-  decide, on the basis of the recommendations of the Council referred to in paragraph 2, whether a majority of the Member States fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency;</p><p>- decide whether it is appropriate for the Community to enter the third stage,</p><p>and if so</p><p>-  set the date for the beginning of the third stage.</p><p>4.  If by the end of 1997 the date for the beginning of the third stage has not been set, the third stage shall start on 1 January 1999. Before 1 July 1998, the Council, meeting in the composition of Heads of State or of Government, after a repetition of the procedure provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2, with the exception of the second indent of paragraph 2, taking into account the reports referred to in paragraph 1 and the opinion of the European Parliament, shall, acting by a qualified majority and on the basis of the recommendations of the Council referred to in paragraph 2, conform which Member States fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency.</p><p>Article 109k</p><p>1.  If the decision has been taken to set the date in accordance with Article 109j(3), the Council shall, on the basis of its recommendations referred to in Article 109j(2), acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission, decide whether any, and if so which, Member States shall have a derogation as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article. Such Member States shall in this Treaty be referred to as &#039;Member States with a derogation`.</p><p>If the Council has confirmed which Member States fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, in accordance with Article 109j(4), those Member States which do not fulfil the conditions shall have a derogation as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article. Such Member States shall in this Treaty be referred to as &#039;Member States with a derogation`.</p><p>2.  At least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB shall report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 109j(1). After consulting the European Parliament and after discussion in the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or of Government, the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions on the basis of the criteria set out in Article 109j(1), and abrogate the derogations of the Member States concerned.</p><p>3.  A derogation referred to in paragraph 1 shall entail that the following Articles do not apply to the Member State concerned: Articles 104c(9) and (11), 105(1), (2), (3) and (5), 105a, 108a, 109, and 109a(2)(b). The exclusion of such a Member State and its national central bank from rights and obligations within the ESCB is laid down in Chapter IX of the Statute of the ESCB.</p><p>4.

The voting rights of Member States with a derogation shall be suspended for the Council decisions referred to in the Articles of this Treaty mentioned in paragraph 3. In that case, by way of derogation from Articles 148 and 189a(1), a qualified majority shall be defined as two thirds of the votes of the representatives of the Member States without a derogation weighted in accordance with Article 148(2), and unanimity of those Member States shall be required for an act requiring unanimity.</p><p>6.  Articles 109h and 109i shall continue to apply to a Member State with a derogation.</p><p>Article 109l</p><p>1.

If there are Member States with a derogation, the number of members of the Executive Board may be smaller than provided for in Article 11.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, but in no circumstances shall it be less than four.</p><p>As soon as the Executive Board is appointed, the ESCB and the ECB shall be established and shall prepare for their full operation as described in this Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. The full exercise of their powers shall start from the first day of the third stage.</p><p>2.  As soon as the ECB is established, it shall, if necessary, take over tasks of the EMI.

At the starting date of the third stage, the Council shall, acting with the unanimity of the Member States without a derogation, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB, adopt the conversion rates at which their currencies shall be irrevocably fixed and at which irrevocably fixed rate the ECU shall be substituted for these currencies, and the ECU will become a currency in its own right. This measure shall by itself not modify the external value of the ECU. The Council shall, acting according to the same procedure, also take the other measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the ECU as the single currency of those Member States.</p><p>5.  If it is decided, according to the procedure set out in Article 109k(2), to abrogate a derogation, the Council shall, acting with the unanimity of the Member States without a derogation and the Member State concerned, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB, adopt the rate at which the ECU shall be substituted for the currency of the Member State concerned, and take the other measures necessary for the introduction of the ECU as the single currency in the Member State concerned.</p><p>Article 109m</p><p>1.  Until the beginning of the third stage, each Member State shall treat its exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest. In so doing, Member States shall take account of the experience acquired in cooperation within the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) and in the developing the ECU, and shall respect existing powers in this field.</p><p>2.

The preceding provisions shall not apply to such drawback of customs duties or charges having equivalent effect nor to such repayment of indirect taxation including turnover taxes, excise duties and other indirect taxes as is allowed when goods are exported from a Member State to a third country, in so far as such drawback or repayment does not exceed the amount imposed, directly or indirectly, on the products exported.</p><p>Article 113 (37**)</p><p>1.
