This Title concerns agricultural products with the exception of products falling within Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 on the common organization of the market in fishery and aquaculture products.</p><p>2. Except where this Act provides otherwise:</p><p>- trade by the new Member States between themselves, with third countries or with the present Member States shall be subject to the regime applicable to the latter Member States. The regime applicable in the Community as at present constituted with regard to import duties and charges having equivalent effect, quantitative restrictions and measures having equivalent effect shall be applicable to the new Member States;</p><p>- the rights and obligations resulting from the common agricultural policy shall be applicable in full in the new Member States.</p><p>3. Subject to the special provisions of this title with regard to different dates or time limits, transitional measures for the agricultural products referred to in paragraph 1 shall cease to apply by the end of the fifth year following the accession of Austria, Finland and Norway. These measures shall nevertheless take full account, for each product, of the total production during the year 1999.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1 Provisions concerning national aids </p><p></p><p>Article 138 </p><p>1. During the transitional period, subject to authorization by the Commission, Norway, Austria and Finland may grant, in an appropriate form, transitional and degressive national aids to producers of basic agricultural products subject to the common agricultural policy.</p><p>These aids may be the subject of differentiation in particular by region.</p><p>2. The Commission shall authorize the aids provided for in paragraph 1:</p><p>- in all cases where the factors introduced by a new Member State show that significant differences exist between the level of support granted by product to its producers before accession and that which may be granted under the common agricultural policy;</p><p>- up to an initial amount equal, at most, to this difference.</p><p>Initial differences of less than 10 % shall not be deemed significant.</p><p>However, the Commission&#039;s authorizations:</p><p>- shall be granted in conformity with the international commitments of the enlarged Community;</p><p>- shall, as far as pigmeat, eggs and poultry are concerned, take account of the price alignment of feed;</p><p>- shall not be granted for tobacco.</p><p>3. The amount of support provided for in paragraph 2 shall be calculated by basic agricultural product. This calculation shall take into consideration in particular the support measures of prices by intervention mechanisms or by other mechanisms as well as the grant of aids linked to surface area, to prices, to the quantity produced or to the production unit, and the grant of aids to holdings for specific products.</p><p>4. Authorizations by the Commission shall:</p><p>- define the maximum initial level of the aids, the rate at which they decrease and, where appropriate, the conditions for the granting thereof, taking account also of other aids resulting from Community legislation which are not covered by this Article;</p><p>- be granted subject to any adjustments which may be rendered necessary:</p><p>- by developments in the common agricultural policy;</p><p>- by developments in the level of prices in the Community.</p><p>Should such adjustments prove necessary, the amount of the aids or the conditions for the granting thereof shall be amended at the Commission&#039;s request or on the basis of a decision by the Commission.</p><p>5. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4, the Commission shall authorize, under paragraph 1, in particular, the national aids provided for in Annex XIII, up to the limits and under the conditions provided for in the said Annex.</p><p></p><p>Article 139 </p><p>1. The Commission shall authorize Austria, Finland and Norway to maintain aids which are not linked to a particular production and which, for this reason, are not taken into consideration for the purpose of calculating the amount of support under Article 138 (3). In particular, aids to holdings shall be authorized under this heading.</p><p>2. The aids provided for in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provisions of Article 138 (4).</p><p>Aids of the same kind provided for by the common agricultural policy or compatible with Community legislation shall be deducted from the amounts thereof.</p><p>3. Aids authorized under this Article shall be abolished at the latest at the end of the transitional period.</p><p>4. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to aids to investment.</p><p></p><p>Article 140 </p><p>The Commission shall authorize Austria, Finland and Norway to grant the transitional national aids provided for in Annex XIV up to the limits and under the conditions provided for therein. In its authorization, the Commission shall lay down the initial level of the aids, to the extent that it does not result from the conditions provided for by the Annex, and the rate at which they decrease.</p><p></p><p>Article 141 </p><p>Where there are serious difficulties resulting from accession which remain after full utilization of the provisions of Articles 138, 139, 140 and 142, and of the other measures resulting from the rules existing in the Community, the Commission may authorize Finland and Norway to grant national aids to producers so as to facilitate their full integration into the common agricultural policy.</p><p></p><p>Article 142 </p><p>1. The Commission shall authorize Norway, Finland and Sweden to grant long-term national aids with a view to ensuring that agricultural activity is maintained in specific regions. These regions should cover the agricultural areas situated to the north of the 62nd Parallel and some adjacent areas south of that parallel affected by comparable climatic conditions rendering agricultural activity particularly difficult.</p><p>2. The regions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined by the Commission, taking into consideration in particular:</p><p>- the low population density;</p><p>- the portion of agricultural land in the overall surface area;</p><p>- the portion of agricultural land devoted to arable crops intended for human consumption, in the agricultural surface area used.</p><p>3. The aids provided for in paragraph 1 may be related to physical factors of production, such as hectares of agricultural land or heads of animal taking account of the relevant limits laid down in the common organizations of the market, as well as the historical production patterns of each farm, but must not:</p><p>- be linked to future production;</p><p>- or lead to an increase in production or in the level of overall support recorded during a pre-accession reference period to be determined by the Commission.</p><p>The aids may be differentiated by region.</p><p>These aids must be granted in particular in order to:</p><p>- maintain traditional primary production and processing naturally suited to the climatic conditions of the regions concerned;</p><p>- improve the structures for the production, marketing and processing of agricultural products;</p><p>- facilitate the disposal of the said products;</p><p>- ensure that the environment is protected and the countryside preserved.</p><p></p><p>Article 143 </p><p>1. The aids provided for in Articles 138 to 142 and any other national aid subject to Commission authorization under this Act shall be notified to the Commission. They may not be applied until such authorization has been given.</p><p>Communication of existing or envisaged aid measures by the new Member States prior to accession shall be deemed to constitute notification on the date of accession.</p><p>2. As regards the aids provided for in Article 142, the Commission shall submit to the Council one year after accession and subsequently every five years a report on:</p><p>- the authorizations granted;</p><p>- the results of the aid granted under such authorizations.</p><p>In preparation for drawing up such reports, Member States in receipt of such authorizations shall supply the Commission in good time with information on the effects of the aids granted, illustrating the development noted in the agricultural economy of the regions in question.</p><p></p><p>Article 144 </p><p>In the field of the aids provided for in Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty:</p><p>(a) among the aids applied in the new Member States prior to accession only those communicated to the Commission by 30 April 1995 will be deemed to be &#039;existing` aids within the meaning of Article 93 (1) of the EC Treaty;</p><p>(b) existing aids and plans intended to grant or alter aids, communicated to the Commission prior to accession, shall be deemed to have been notified on the date of accession.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2 Other provisions </p><p></p><p>Article 145 </p><p>1. Public stocks held on 1 January 1995 by the new Member States on account of their market-support policy shall be borne by the Community at the value resulting from application of Article 8 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guidance Section.</p><p>2. Any stock of products in free circulation within the territory of the new Member States on 1 January 1995 and exceeding the quantity which could be regarded as constituting a normal carryover of stock must be eliminated by these Member States at their cost under Community procedures to be specified and within deadlines to be determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 149 (1). The concept of normal carryover stock shall be defined for each product on the basis of criteria and objectives particular to each common market organization.</p><p>3. The stocks referred to in paragraph 1 shall be deducted from the quantity exceeding the normal carryover of stock.</p><p></p><p>Article 146 </p><p>The Kingdom of Norway is required to ensure that from 1 January 1995 all statutory and contractual provisions which give a monopoly to the Norwegian Grain Corporation (Statens Kornforretning) or any successor organization in relation to the import, export or the buying and selling of agricultural products shall be abolished.</p><p>However, Article 85 of the EC Treaty shall be applicable only as from 1 January 1997 to agreements, decisions and concerted practices implemented by the Norwegian Grain Corporation insofar as:</p><p>- they have objectives other than those stated in the first subparagraph;</p><p>- they do not involve fixing of prices, sharing of markets or control of production.</p><p></p><p>Article 147 </p><p>In the agricultural sector where trade between one or more new Member States and the Community as constituted on 31 December 1994, or trade between the new Member States themselves, causes serious disturbances on the market of Austria, Finland or Norway before 1 January 2000, the Commission acting at the request of the Member State concerned, shall decide, within 24 hours of receiving such a request, on such protective measures as it considers necessary. The measures thus decided on shall be applicable forthwith, shall take account of the interest of all parties concerned and shall not entail frontier controls.</p><p></p><p>Article 148 </p><p>1. Unless otherwise stipulated in specific cases, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the necessary provisions to implement this Title.</p><p>2. The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may make the adaptations to the provisions appearing in this Title which may prove necessary as a result of a modification in Community rules.</p><p></p><p>Article 149 </p><p>1. If transitional measures are necessary to facilitate the transition from the existing regime in the new Member States to that resulting from application of the common organization of the markets under the conditions set out in this Title, such measures shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC or, as appropriate, in the corresponding Articles of the other Regulations on the common organization of agricultural markets. These measures may be taken during a period expiring on 31 December 1997 and their application shall be limited to that date.</p><p>2. The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may extend the period referred to in paragraph 1.</p><p></p><p>Article 150 </p><p>1. The transitional measures relating to implementation of the instruments concerning the common agricultural policy not specified in this Act, including in the field of structures, which are required as a result of accession shall be adopted prior to accession in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 3 and shall enter into force on the date of accession at the earliest.</p><p>2. The transitional measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include in particular adaptations to instruments making provision for present Member States for co-financing of certain actions in the field of statistics and control of expenditure.</p><p>They may also stipulate that, under certain conditions, national aid corresponding at most to the difference between the price recorded in a new Member State prior to accession and that resulting from application of this Act may be granted to private operators, whether natural or legal persons, holding stocks of products referred to in Article 138 (1) or resulting from processing thereof on 1 January 1995.</p><p>3. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the transitional measures referred to in paragaphs 1 and 2. Nevertheless, the measures affecting instruments initially adopted by the Commission will be adopted by this institution following the procedure referred to in Article 149 (1).</p><p></p><p>TITLE VII OTHER PROVISIONS </p><p></p><p>Article 151 </p><p>1. The Acts listed in Annex XV to this Act shall apply in respect of the new Member States under the conditions laid down in that Annex.</p><p>2. At the duly substantiated request of one of the new Member States, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may, before 1 January 1995, take measures consisting of temporary derogations from acts of the institutions adopted between 1 January 1994 and the date of signature of the Accession Treaty.</p><p></p><p>Article 152 </p><p>1. If, before 1 January 1996, difficulties arise which are serious and liable to persist in any sector of the economy or which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a given area, a new Member State may apply for authorization to take protective measures in order to rectify the situation and adjust the sector concerned to the economy of the common market.</p><p>In the same circumstances, any present Member State may apply for authorization to take protective measures with regard to one or more of the new Member States.</p><p>2. Upon request by the State concerned, the Commission shall, by emergency procedure, determine the protective measures which it considers necessary, specifying the conditions and modalities in which they are to be put into effect.</p><p>In the event of serious economic difficulties and at the express request of the Member State concerned, the Commission shall act within five working days of the receipt of the request accompanied by the relevant background information. The measures thus decided on shall be applicable forthwith, shall take account of the interest of all parties concerned and shall not entail frontier controls.</p><p>3. The measures authorized under paragraph 2 may involve derogations from the rules of the EC Treaty, the ECSC Treaty and this Act to such an extent and for such periods as are strictly necessary in order to attain the objectives referred to in paragraph 1. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the common market.</p><p></p><p>Article 153 </p><p>In order not to hamper the proper functioning of the internal market, the enforcement of the new Member States&#039; national rules during the transitional periods referred to in this Act shall not lead to border controls between Member States.</p><p></p><p>PART FIVE PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ACT TITLE I SETTING UP OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND BODIES </p><p></p><p>Article 154 </p><p>The European Parliament shall meet no later than one month after accession.

From 1996 onwards, depending on the combined transport technology used, there will, in addition, be an increase in annual combined transport capacity of up to 1,8 million consignments or up to 33 million tonnes.</p><p>In the medium term:</p><p>By 1998 this capacity will be expanded by a further 10 million tonnes a year through additional selective two-track development and safety and operating improvements on the transit routes.</p><p>In the long term:</p><p>The Pyhrn-Schober route will be upgraded to two-track running. A Brenner base tunnel should further improve capacity on the Brenner route to as many as 400 trains a day. Depending on the technology chosen, the newly created combined rail transport capacity could rise to 60 to 89 million tonnes a year after 2010.</p><p>Definitions:</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX 4 referred to in Article 11 (2) (a) of the Protocol </p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>The figures in column 3 shall be adapted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16 to take account of transit journeys by heavy goods vehicles registered in Finland, Norway and Sweden, based on indicative values for the respective countries calculated on the basis of the number of transit journeys in 1991 and a standard value of NOx emission of 15,8 grammes NOx/kWh.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX 5 </p><p></p><p>CALCULATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF ECOPOINTS referred to in Article 11 (2) (b) of the Protocol </p><p>1.

DECLARATIONS ADOPTED BY THE PLENIPOTENTIARIES</p><p></p><p>1. Joint Declaration on Common Foreign and Security Policy</p><p>1. The Union notes the confirmation by Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden of their full acceptance of the rights and obligations attaching to the Union and its institutional framework, known as the &#039;acquis communautaire`, as it applies to present Member States. This includes in particular the content, principles and political objectives of the Treaties, including those of the Treaty on European Union.</p><p>The Union and the Kingdom of Norway, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden agree that:</p><p>- accession to the Union should strengthen the internal coherence of the Union and its capacity to act effectively in foreign and security policy;</p><p>- the new Member States will, from the time of their accession, be ready and able to participate fully and actively in the Common Foreign and Security Policy as defined in the Treaty on European Union;</p><p>- the new Member States will, on accession, take on in their entirety and without reservation all the objectives of the Treaty, the provisions of Title V thereof, and the relevant declarations attached to it;</p><p>- the new Member States will be ready and able to support the specific policies of the Union in force at the time of their accession.</p><p>2. With regard to Member States&#039; obligations deriving from the Treaty on European Union concerning the implementation of the Union&#039;s Common Foreign and Security Policy it is understood that on the day of accession the legal framework of the acceding countries will be compatible with the &#039;acquis`.</p><p></p><p>2. Joint Declaration on Article 157 (4) of the Act of Accession</p><p>The new Member States will take part in a system involving the rotation of three Advocates-General in the alphabetical order applied at present, it being understood that Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom will not take part in that system, as they will have a permanent Advocate-General each. The alphabetical order is thus the following:</p><p>Belgique (1988-1994), Danmark (1991-1997), Ellas (1994-2000), Ireland, Luxembourg, Nederland, Norge, Österreich, Portugal, Suomi, Sverige.</p><p>It follows that as from accession one Advocate-General of Spanish nationality and one of Irish nationality will be appointed. The term of office of the Spanish Advocate-General will expire on 6 October 1997, and the term of office of the Irish Advocate-General will expire on 6 October 2000.</p><p></p><p>3. Joint Declaration on the Court of Justice of the European Communities</p><p>Such additional measures as may prove necessary following the accession of the new Member States should be taken by the Council which, at the request of the Court, may increase the number of Advocates-General to nine and make the necessary adjustments pursuant to the provisions of the third paragraph of Article 32a of the ECSC Treaty, the third paragraph of Article 166 of the EC Treaty and the third paragraph of Article 138 of the Euratom Treaty.</p><p></p><p>4. Joint Declaration on the application of the Euratom Treaty</p><p>The Contracting Parties, recalling that the Treaties on which the European Union is founded apply to all Member States on a non-discriminatory basis and without prejudice to the rules governing the internal market, acknowledge that, as Contracting Parties to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, Member States decide to produce or not to produce nuclear energy according to their specific policy orientations.</p><p>As regards the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, it is the responsibility of each Member State to define its own policy.</p><p></p><p>5. Joint Declaration on secondary residences</p><p>Nothing in the &#039;acquis communautaire` prevents individual Member States from taking national, regional or local measures regarding secondary residences, provided that they are necessary for land-use planning and environmental protection and apply without direct or indirect discrimination between nationals of the Member States in conformity with the &#039;acquis`.</p><p></p><p>6. Joint Declaration on standards for the protection of the environment, health and product safety</p><p>The Contracting Parties emphasize the great importance of promoting a high level of health, safety and environmental protection as part of Community action, in conformity with the objectives and in accordance with the criteria laid down in the Treaty on European Union. In this context they also refer to the Resolution of 1 February 1993 on a Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development.</p><p>Conscious of the attachment of the new Member States to the preservation of the standards they have implemented in certain fields, owing in particular to their special geographical and climatic conditions, the Contracting Parties have agreed, exceptionally and for specific cases, on a procedure for examining the existing &#039;acquis communautaire`, with the full participation of the new Member States, under the terms and conditions laid down in the Accession Treaty.</p><p>Without prejudice to the outcome of the agreed examination procedure, the Contracting Parties undertake to make every endeavour to conclude that procedure before the expiry of the transitional period laid down. At the end of the transitional period, the entire &#039;acquis communautaire` will be applicable in the new Member States under the same conditions as in the present Member States of the Union.</p><p></p><p>7. Joint Declaration on Articles 32, 69, 84, and 112 of the Act of Accession</p><p>The Contracting Parties recall that in the Ministerial meeting of 21 December 1993 the Conferences noted that:</p><p>- the goal of the agreed solution is to take decisions before the end of the transitional period;</p><p>- the review of the acquis communautaire shall be without prejudice to the result;</p><p>- when undertaking the review the Union will also take into account the criteria laid down in Article 130r(3) of the EC Treaty.</p><p></p><p>8. Joint Declaration on the institutional procedures of the Accession Treaty</p><p>In adopting the institutional provisions of the Accession Treaty, the Member States and the applicant countries agree that, as well as examining the legislative role of the European Parliament and the other matters envisaged in the Treaty on European Union, the Intergovernmental Conference to be convened in 1996 will consider the questions relating to the number of members of the Commission and the weighting of the votes of the Member States in the Council. It will also consider any measures deemed necessary to facilitate the work of the Institutions and guarantee their effective operation.</p><p></p><p>9. Joint Declaration on Article 172 of the Act of Accession</p><p>The Contracting Parties note that any amendment to the EEA Agreement and the Agreement between the EFTA States on the establishment of a Surveillance Authority and a Court of Justice needs the consent of the contracting parties concerned.</p><p>The Plenipotentiaries have taken note of the exchange of letters on the arrangement regarding the procedure for adopting certain decisions and other measures to be taken during the period preceding accession which has been reached within the Conference between the European Union and the States which have applied for accession to that Union and which is annexed to this Final Act.</p><p>Finally, the following Declarations have been made and are annexed to this Final Act:</p><p>A.

Joint Declarations: The present Member States / Kingdom of Norway</p><p></p><p>10. Joint Declaration on management of fisheries resources in waters north of 62° N</p><p>The Contracting Parties note the vulnerable and sensitive eco-system of the Barents Sea and northern waters, and recognize the vital need to maintain sound management, based on sustainable conservation and optimal utilisation of all stocks in these waters.</p><p>They agree that upon the integration of these waters into the common fisheries policy (CFP), such integration shall be based on the existing management regime in order to continue and improve current technical, control and enforcement standards.</p><p>They agree that established regional marine research and scientific institutions close to the relevant waters should continue to make important contributions to the decision-making process in order to provide for rapid and necessary management decisions within the framework of the CFP.</p><p>They agree that the negotiations with Russia conducted within the framework of the CFP should be inspired by the principles and practices developed in the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission.</p><p>They agree that the present system, whereby consultation with interested fisheries organisations are carried out before negotiations with Russia take place, should be maintained.</p><p>They further agree that management objectives and measures include:</p><p>- that due account be taken of the interrelationship between stocks in a multi-species, management perspective,</p><p>- that the management of pelagic stocks should take into account that such species constitute an important source of food for other species,</p><p>- that optimal and stable outtake of the stocks should be ensured, in the long term,</p><p>- that when fixing the TAC for a stock, due account should be taken of the conservation of the spawning stock to ensure sufficient recruitment,</p><p>- that catches of demersal stocks considered to be within safe biological limits, should be kept within the reproductive ability of the stock and take due account of the special conditions relevant for each individual stock,</p><p>- that for demersal stocks outside safe biological limits, measures should be taken to rebuild the stock to sustainable level, also taking into account the minimum requirements of the fishing industry,</p><p>- that considerable significance will continue to be attached to the advice of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management (ACFM).</p><p>The Contracting Parties recognize that the special interests of Norway as the coastal state in waters North of 62° N and of all parties concerned must be taken into account in the future management of these waters according to the rules of the common fisheries policy.</p><p>In addition, and as a temporary derogation to the rules in order to encourage a gradual integration of Norway to the CFP, the Contracting Parties have agreed that from the date of accession:</p><p>1. Norway is authorized to establish TAC levels and to maintain its fisheries agreement with Russia for a transitional period until 1 July 1998 at the latest; during this transitional period, the establishment of TAC levels and the management of this agreement is ensured by Norway in close association with the Commission;</p><p>2. Norway can maintain in these waters on a non-discriminatory basis its current system of:</p><p>- technical regulations for a transitional period of 1 year,</p><p>- a discard ban for a transitional period of 3 years,</p><p>- control measures, and in particular the closing and opening of sensitive areas for a transitional period of 3 years.</p><p>During these transitional periods, the Union will examine how best these regulatory mechanisms can be integrated into the common fisheries policy.</p><p></p><p>11. Joint Declaration on the 12-mile limit</p><p>The Contracting Parties recognize the major importance to Norway of the maintenance of viable fishing communities in coastal regions. When reviewing the present arrangements on access to waters within the 12-mile limit in order to decide on future arrangements, the institutions of the Union will pay special attention to the interests of such communities in the Member States.</p><p></p><p>12. Joint Declaration on ownership of fishing vessels</p><p>The Contracting Parties take note of the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and recognize that, in the context of the common fisheries policy, one of the aims of the system of national quotas, which are allocated to Member States according to the principle of relative stability, is to safeguard the particular needs of regions where local populations are especially dependent on fisheries and related industries.</p><p>That aim may justify conditions designed to ensure that there is a real economic link between vessels fishing against the quotas of a Member State and that Member State, if the purpose of such conditions is that the populations dependent on fisheries and related industries should benefit from the quotas.</p><p></p><p>13. Joint Declaration on the supply of raw material for the fish processing industry in northern Norway</p><p>The Contracting Parties note the request of the Kingdom of Norway regarding the supply of raw material for the fish processing industry in northern Norway and recognize the need to ensure a satisfactory balance in supplies in the light of the special situation for that industry. This is to be duly taken into account when the Union establishes autonomous tariff quotas for fish for the processing industry following Norway&#039;s accession.</p><p></p><p>14. Declaration on Article 147 on the Norwegian food processing industry</p><p>The Contracting Parties took note of the following Declaration made by the Commission:</p><p>&#039;When examining a possible request from Norway for measures to be taken in the event of serious market disruptions, the Commission shall take account of the particular restructuring problem of the Norwegian food processing industry and shall ensure that any necessary measure is taken sufficiently promptly to prevent long-term damage.</p><p>The measures taken by the Commission may include, during a period of 3 years, a monitoring system and indicative ceilings allowing that the opening of the market will not create such disturbances as could hamper the necessary restructuring of the food processing sector in Norway for the following products produced from indigenous primary agricultural commodities: meat products, flour, compound feeding stuffs, processed peas and carrots and dairy products with the exception of butter, skimmed milk powder and soft cheese.`.</p><p></p><p>15. Joint Declaration on Svalbard</p><p>The Contracting Parties agree that the access of the fleets ot the EU Member States to the fisheries resources in the waters up to 200 miles around Svalbard, to harvest the fishing quotas decided by the Union, will remain unchanged in accordance with the present fishery status quo.</p><p>The Parties furthermore agree that the living resources in the said waters must be managed in such a way as to provide for a permanent and sustainable yield to the benefit of the EU Member States reflecting their fishing rights in these waters. In particular, such management shall not impair the opportunity of the fleets of the EU Member States to catch their full quotas and shall fully respect the conduct of normal fishing operations.</p><p></p><p>B. Joint Declarations: The present Member States / Republic of Austria</p><p></p><p>16. Joint Declaration on the free movement of workers</p><p>Should the accession of Austria give rise to difficulties relating to the free movement of workers, the matter may be brought before the institutions of the Union in order to obtain a solution to this problem. This solution will be in strict accordance with the provisions of the Treaties (including those of the Treaty on European Union) and the provisions adopted in application thereof, in particular those relating to the free movement of workers.</p><p></p><p>17. Joint Declaration on safeguard measures under the agreements with countries of Central and Eastern Europe</p><p>1. The &#039;Europe` agreements between the Communities and their Member States and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe include provisions for the Communities to take appropriate safeguard measures, under certain conditions laid down in these Agreements.</p><p>2.
