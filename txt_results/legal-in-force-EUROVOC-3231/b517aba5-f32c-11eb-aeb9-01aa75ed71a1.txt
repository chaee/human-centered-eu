      COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2021/1256
         of 21 April 2021
         amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 as regards the integration of sustainability risks in the governance of insurance and reinsurance undertakings
         (Text with EEA relevance)
         THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
         Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
         Having regard to Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) 
         (, and in particular Article 50(1) and Article 135(1), point (a), thereof,1)Whereas:
                  (1)
               The transition to a low-carbon, more sustainable, resource-efficient and circular economy in line with the Sustainable Development Goals is key to ensuring the long-term competitiveness of the economy of the Union. In 2016, the Union concluded the Paris Agreement 
                  (. Article 2(1), point (c), of the Paris Agreement sets out the objective of strengthening the response to climate change by, among others, making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.2)
                  (2)
               Recognising that challenge, the Commission presented the European Green Deal 
                  ( in December 2019. That Green Deal represents a new growth strategy that aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. This also requires offering clear, long-term signals to guide investors, to avoid stranded assets and to raise sustainable finance.3)
                  (3)
               In March 2018, the Commission published its Action Plan ‘Financing Sustainable Growth’ 
                  (, setting up an ambitious and comprehensive strategy on sustainable finance. One of the objectives set out in that Action Plan is to reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. The impact assessment underpinning subsequent legislative initiatives published in May 2018 4)( demonstrated the need to clarify that sustainability factors should be taken into account by insurance and reinsurance undertakings as part of their duties towards policyholders. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should therefore assess not only all relevant financial risks on an ongoing basis, but also all relevant sustainability risks as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5)( that, where they occur, could cause an actual or potential material negative impact on the value of an investment or a liability. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 6)( does not explicitly refer to sustainability risks. For that reason and to ensure that the system of governance is properly implemented and adhered to, it is necessary to clarify that the system of governance of insurance and reinsurance undertakings and the assessment of those undertakings’ overall solvency needs should reflect sustainability risks.7)
                  (4)
               Insurance undertakings that disclose principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should also adapt their processes, systems and internal controls with respect to those disclosures.
                  (5)
               Given the ambitions of the Commission to ensure that climate and environmental risk are managed and integrated into the financial system and the importance of remuneration policies in ensuring that the staff of insurance and reinsurance undertakings effectively manage risks identified by the risk management system, the remuneration policies of insurance and reinsurance undertakings should contain information on how those policies take into account the integration of sustainability risks in the risk management system.
                  (6)
               The prudent person principle laid down in Article 132 of Directive 2009/138/EC requires that insurance and reinsurance undertakings only invest in assets the risks of which they can identify, measure, monitor, manage, control and report properly. In order to ensure that climate and environmental risks are effectively managed by insurance and reinsurance undertakings, the implementation of the prudent person principle should take into account sustainability risks and insurance and reinsurance undertakings should reflect in their investment process the sustainability preferences of their customers as taken into account in the product approval process.
                  (7)
               Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 should therefore be amended accordingly.
                  (8)
               Supervisory authorities and insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be given sufficient time to adapt to the new requirements contained in this Regulation. Its application should therefore be deferred,
                  HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
