            supplementing Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards on the calculation of the stress scenario risk measure
            (Text with EEA relevance)
         THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
            Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
            Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 
            (, and in particular Article 325bk(3), fourth subparagraph, thereof,1)Whereas:
                        (1)
                     To ensure a level playing field among institutions in the Union and to minimise regulatory arbitrage, the methodologies for developing extreme scenarios of future shock for non-modellable risk factors should be based on the international standards agreed in January 2019 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) (Basel framework), and should take into account the materiality of the own funds requirements for non-modellable risk factors. Therefore, specific and detailed methodologies for developing extreme scenarios of future shock for non-modellable risk factors should be laid down.
                        (2)
                     The quality of data and the number of observations that are available to determine future shocks for non-modellable risk factors may vary significantly from one non-modellable risk factor to another. It is therefore necessary to ensure that extreme scenarios of future shock cover a wide range of cases. For that reason, it is necessary to provide for alternative sets of methodologies that institutions may use depending on the quality and the number of observations that are available for each non-modellable risk factor. Furthermore, institutions should reflect in their calculations the fact that fewer available data leads to a higher uncertainty of the estimates or values used to determine the extreme scenarios of future shock and should therefore become more conservative.
                        (3)
                     Given its accuracy, one method to determine the extreme scenario of future shock for a non-modellable risk factor should consist of directly calculating the expected shortfall measure of the losses that would occur when applying a shock to that non-modellable risk factor with the historically observed levels during the relevant stress period. However, such method would provide reliable results only where the institution has a significant amount of data for that stress period, and would require many loss calculations per risk factor leading to a high computational effort. It is therefore necessary to provide for an alternative method that requires a significant lower number of loss calculations and applies a stepwise approach. Under that alternative method, institutions should first calculate an expected shortfall measure on the returns observed for a non-modellable risk factor, and then calculate the loss that corresponds to the movement in the risk factor identified by that expected shortfall measure. Such stepwise approach should also address the specific case where the number of observations for a non-modellable risk factor in the stress period concerned is insufficient to obtain accurate and prudent estimates. Since that situation can be expected to occur only in a limited number of cases, those cases should be addressed by leveraging on methodologies that institutions have implemented for other non-modellable risk factors for which they have more observations or, where possible, on the alternative standardised approach.
                        (4)
                     The Basel framework requires that the market risk own funds requirements for non-modellable risk factors have to be calibrated to a period of stress that is the same for all non-modellable risk factors that belong to the same broad category of risk factors. To determine extreme scenarios of future shock on the basis of data observed during that identified period, institutions should collect data for non-modellable risk factors for that identified stress period.
                        (5)
                     To ensure harmonisation of the calculation of the stress scenario risk measures across institutions in the Union, it is necessary to specify how institutions should identify the stress period. Those specifications should be proportionate to the purpose, and should neither require an excessive computational effort, nor the implementation of specific pricing methods. The global financial crisis of 2007–2008 has been a major stress event for the financial system. The stress period to be identified should therefore start at least from 1 January 2007. To ensure that the stress period remains relevant to an institution’s trading portfolio, institutions should periodically review that stress period. However, to limit the administrative burden on institutions, it should be only required that the frequency of such review follows at least the same quarterly frequency as the corresponding supervisory reporting.
                        (6)
                     The Basel framework requires that institutions determine extreme scenarios of future shock by using the pricing methods of their risk measurement model, as those methods are used in the context of the back-testing and the profit and loss attribution test. There may be scenarios of future shock for which those pricing methods cannot determine the corresponding loss for some financial instruments or commodities. Where that is the case, institutions should act in a prudentially sound manner and target only those instruments that are affected by the pricing failure. The methodologies implemented by the institution to address those cases are not to affect in any way the results of the back-testing and the profit and loss attribution requirements laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/2059 
                        (.2)
                        (7)
                     Article 325bk(3), second subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 requires that the level of own funds requirements for market risk for a non-modellable risk factor is to be as high as the expected shortfall measure for that risk factor referred in Article 325bb of that Regulation, i.e. an expected shortfall of losses at a 97,5 % confidence level over a period of stress. The statistical estimators and the parameters for determining that expected shortfall measure should therefore be set in such a way that that confidence level is met.
                        (8)
                     According to the Basel framework, the regulatory extreme scenario of future shock should be the one leading to the maximum loss that may occur due to a change in the non-modellable risk factor. It should therefore be specified what institutions should consider as maximum loss in cases where the maximum loss is not finite.
                        (9)
                     To ensure consistency with the Basel framework, institutions should be able to determine the stress scenario risk measure for more than one non-modellable risk factors where those non-modellable risk factors are part of a curve or a surface, and where those risk factors belong to the same non-modellable bucket among those set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/2060 
                        (, and provided that institutions have assessed their modellability in accordance with the standardised bucketing approach referred to in that Delegated Regulation. Institutions should therefore be allowed to compute a single stress scenario risk measure for more than one non-modellable risk factor under those conditions only.3)
                        (10)
                     To ensure the adequacy of the own funds requirements for non-modellable risk factors with the risk profile of institutions, institutions should reflect in the aggregation of the stress scenario risk measures those risks that were not yet captured when determining the extreme scenario of future shock, including the liquidity horizons of the non-modellable risk factors. To ensure a level playing field, the stress scenario risk measures should be aggregated by applying the aggregation formula agreed in the Basel framework.
                        (11)
                     This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted to the Commission by the European Banking Authority.
                        (12)
                     The European Banking Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits, and requested the advice of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council

                                       for each non-modellable risk factor within the non-modellable bucket, they shall apply to the value of the non-modellable risk factor the shocks that corresponds to the returns in the corresponding time series obtained in accordance with point (ii);
                                          (iv)
                                       they shall determine the time series of losses by calculating, for each date corresponding to a value in the time series obtained in accordance with point (iii), the loss that would occur if the non-modellable risk factors in the non-modellable bucket takes the values included in those time series for that date;
                              (b)

                                    X.

               Article 12
                  Determination of the stress period
                  1.   Institutions shall determine the stress period for the non-modellable risk factors in a broad category of risk factors by identifying the 12-month observation period maximising the value obtained in accordance with following formula:
                        where:
                              —
                              i denotes the broad risk factor category;

                              —
                                        is the rescaled stress scenario risk measure for the non-modellable risk factor or the non-modellable standardised bucket 
                                    j calculated in accordance with Article 16.2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions may determine the stress period for the non-modellable risk factors in a broad risk factor category by identifying the 12-month observation period maximising the partial expected shortfall measure 
                         referred to in Article 325bb(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Where institutions apply this derogation, they shall provide evidence that the stress period identified represents a period of financial stress for its non-modellable risk factors. Institutions shall take into account how their portfolio is exposed to the non-modellable risk factors in the broad category of risk factors.
                  3.   When determining the stress period, institutions shall use an observation period starting at least from 1 January 2007, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities.
               4.   Institutions shall review the stress period identified at least with a quarterly frequency.
            Article 13
                  Computation of the losses
                  1.   Institutions shall calculate the loss corresponding to a scenario of future shock applied to one or more non-modellable risk factors by calculating the loss on the portfolio of positions for which they calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with the alternative internal model approach set out in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 1b, of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and that occurs if that scenario of future shock is applied to that non-modellable risk factor or those non-modellable risk factors in a standardised bucket, and all other risk factors remain unchanged.
                  2.   Institutions shall calculate the loss corresponding to a scenario of future shock applied to one or more non-modellable risk factors by using the pricing methods used in the risk measurement model.
                  3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, where institutions cannot calculate the loss for some financial instruments or commodities included in the portfolio referred to in paragraph 1, corresponding to a scenario of future shock applied to one or several non-modellable risk factors by using their pricing methods, they shall apply the following steps in the following order:
                              (a)
                           they shall identify those financial instruments or commodities and the cause of the failure of the pricing calculation;
                              (b)
                           they shall use sensitivity-based pricing methods, including at least the material first order and material second order terms of Taylor series approximations, to reflect the change in the price of those financial instruments or commodities due to changes in the non-modellable risk factors in this scenario of future shock.
               4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, institutions may, only for the purpose of determining the stress period in accordance with Article 12(1), calculate the loss corresponding to a scenario of future shock applied to one or more non-modellable risk factors using sensitivity-based pricing methods. Institutions shall demonstrate that the price changes that are not captured by the sensitivity-based pricing methods would not modify the stress period identified by the institution.

               REGULATORY EXTREME SCENARIO OF FUTURE SHOCK
            Article 14
                  Determination of the regulatory extreme scenario of future shock
                  1.   The regulatory extreme scenario of future shock referred to in Article 325bk(3), point (b), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 shall be a shock leading to the maximum loss that may occur due to a change in the non-modellable risk factor where such maximum loss is finite.
                  2.   Where the maximum loss referred to in paragraph 1 is not finite, institutions shall determine the regulatory extreme scenario of future shock by applying the following steps in the following order:
                              (a)
                           they shall use an expert-based approach using qualitative and quantitative information available to identify a loss due to a change in the value taken by the non-modellable risk factor that will not be exceeded with a level of certainty equal to 99,95 % on a 10 business day horizon in a future period of financial stress equivalent to the stress period identified for the non-modellable risk factor. When doing so, institutions shall take into account the skewness and the excess kurtosis that may characterise the returns of the non-modellable risk factor in a period of financial stress and shall justify any distributional or statistical assumptions taken for identifying that loss;
                              (b)
                              they shall multiply the loss obtained in accordance with point (a) by 
                                    where:

                                                   , and where 
                                                LH is the liquidity horizon for the non-modellable risk factor or for the risk factors within the non-modellable standardised bucket referred to in Article 325bd of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
                              (c)
                           they shall identify the regulatory extreme scenario of future shock as the shock leading to the loss resulting from points (a) and (b).
                  3.   Where institutions calculate a stress scenario risk measure for more than one non-modellable risk factor as referred to in Article 325bk(3), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the regulatory extreme scenario of future shock referred to in Article 325bk(3), point (b), of that Regulation shall be a scenario leading to the maximum loss that may occur due to a change in the values taken by those non-modellable risk factors.
               4.   By way of derogation of paragraph 3, where institutions calculate a stress scenario risk measure for more than one non-modellable risk factor as referred to in Article 325bk(3), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the maximum loss referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article is not finite, institutions shall determine the regulatory extreme scenario of future shock by applying the following steps in the following order:
                              (a)
                           they shall use an expert-based approach using qualitative and quantitative information available to identify a loss due to a change in the values taken by the non-modellable risk factors that will not be exceeded with a level of certainty equal to 99,95 % on a 10 business day horizon in a future period of financial stress equivalent to the stress period for the non-modellable risk factors. When doing so, institutions shall take into account the skewness and the excess kurtosis that may characterise the returns of the non-modellable risk factors in a period of financial stress and shall justify any distributional or statistical assumptions taken for identifying that loss;
                              (b)
                              they shall multiply the loss obtained in accordance with point (a) by 
                                    ;
                                    where:
                                          —
                                                   , and where 
                                                LH is the liquidity horizon for the non-modellable risk factors referred to in Article 325bd of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
                              (c)
                           they shall identify the regulatory extreme scenario of future shock as the scenario leading to the loss resulting from points (a) and (b).

                           (b)
                        institutions assessed the modellability of those risk factors, by determining the modellability of the standardised bucket to which they belong in accordance with Article 4(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/2060.

               2.   Where the stress scenario risk measure for which the institutions are determining the uncertainty compensation factor has been determined for a non-modellable standardised bucket, the uncertainty compensation factor shall be equal to:
                        where:
                              —
