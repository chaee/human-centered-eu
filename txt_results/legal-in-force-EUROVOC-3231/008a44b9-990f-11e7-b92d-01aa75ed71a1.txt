      COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2017/1542
      of 8 June 2017
      amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 concerning the calculation of regulatory capital requirements for certain categories of assets held by insurance and reinsurance undertakings (infrastructure corporates)
      (Text with EEA relevance)
      THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
      Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
      Having regard to Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II)
       (, and in particular Article 50(1)(a) and 111(1)(b), (c) and (m) thereof,1)Whereas:
               (1)
            The Investment Plan for Europe focuses on removing obstacles to investment, providing visibility and technical assistance to investment projects and making smarter use of new and existing financial resources. In particular, the third pillar of the Investment Plan is based on removing barriers to investment and providing greater regulatory predictability in order to keep Europe attractive for investments.
               (2)
            One of the objectives of the Capital Markets Union is to mobilise capital in Europe and channel it to, among others, infrastructure projects that need it to expand and create jobs. Insurance companies, in particular life insurers, are among the largest institutional investors in Europe, with the ability to provide equity as well as debt funding to long term infrastructure.
               (3)
            On 2 April 2016, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/467
                (, amending Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/352) (, entered into force which created a distinct asset class for infrastructure projects for the purpose of risk calibrations.3)
               (4)
            The Commission requested and received further technical advice from the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) as regards the criteria and calibration of a new asset class for infrastructure corporates. That technical advice also recommended some changes to the criteria for qualifying infrastructure projects investments as introduced by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/467.
               (5)
            In order to cover structured project finance situations involving multiple legal entities of a corporate group, the definition of infrastructure project entity should be replaced and expanded to cover both individual entities and corporate groups. To cover entities that earn a substantial portion of their revenues through infrastructure activities, the wording of the revenue criteria should be amended. To assess the sources of revenues of an infrastructure entity the most recent financial year where available or a financing proposal such as a bonds prospectus or financial projections in a loan application should be used. The definition of infrastructure assets should include physical assets so that the relevant infrastructure entities may qualify.
               (6)
            To avoid an outright exclusion of infrastructure entities that are unable to provide security to lenders on all assets for legal or ownership reasons, mechanisms should be captured that allow other security arrangements in favour of debt providers.
               (7)
            Taking into account situations where the pledge prior to default may not be permissible under the national law, the requirement that equity is pledged to debt providers should be included in other security arrangements.
               (8)
            Where the consent by the existing debt providers is implicit in the terms of the relevant document such as maximum indebtedness limit, further debt issuance by an existing infrastructure entity or corporate group should be allowed for qualifying infrastructure investments.
               (9)
            Calibrations in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 should be proportionate to the risk involved.
               (10)
            Based on EIOPA's technical advice to amend the existing treatment of qualifying infrastructure project investments the existing provisions for infrastructure projects should be amended.
               (11)
            EIOPA's technical advice as well as complementary evidence confirms that qualifying infrastructure corporate investments can be safer than non-infrastructure investments. Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 should be amended to include the new risk calibrations for debt investment in qualifying infrastructure corporates to distinguish these investments from non-infrastructure investments.
               (12)
            Appropriate definitions and qualifying criteria should ensure prudent investment behaviour by insurance undertakings. Those definitions and criteria should ensure that only safer investments will benefit from lower calibrations.
               (13)
            The diversification of revenues may not always be possible for infrastructure entities that provide core infrastructure assets or services to other infrastructure businesses. In such situations take-or-pay contracts should be allowed in the assessment of the predictability of revenues.
               (14)
            Stress testing as a part of investment risk management should consider risks arising from non-infrastructure activities. However, in order to make a prudent assessment of the investment risk the revenues generated by such activities should not be taken into account when determining whether the financial obligations can be met.
               (15)
            Following the introducing of the new qualifying infrastructure corporate asset class, other provisions of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 should be aligned accordingly, such as the formula for the solvency capital requirement and the due diligence requirements which are essential for prudent investment decisions by insurance companies.
               (16)
            Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 should therefore be amended accordingly.
               (17)
            To allow for immediate investments in this long-term infrastructure asset class, it is important to ensure this Regulation enters into force as soon as possible, on the day following that of its publication in the 
               Official Journal of the European Union,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
      Article 1

                        the infrastructure assets and infrastructure entity are governed by a regulatory or contractual framework that provides debt providers and equity investors with a high degree of protection including the following:
                                       (a)
                                    the contractual framework shall include provisions that effectively protect debt providers and equity investors against losses resulting from the termination of the project by the party which agrees to purchase the goods or services provided by the infrastructure project, unless one of the following conditions is met:

                                    the infrastructure entity has sufficient reserve funds or other financial arrangements to cover the contingency funding and working capital requirements of the project;

                           (a)
                        a documented assessment of how the infrastructure entity satisfies the criteria set out in Article 164a or Article 164b, which has been subject to a validation process, carried out by persons that are free from influence from those persons responsible for the assessment of the criteria, and have no potential conflicts of interest with those persons;

                        a confirmation that any financial model for the cash flows of the infrastructure entity has been subject to a validation process carried out by persons that are free from influence from those persons responsible for the development of the financial model, and have no potential conflicts of interest with those persons.

Any stress tests shall be commensurate with the nature, scale and complexity of the risk inherent in the infrastructure project.
                  3.   The stress testing shall consider risks arising from non-infrastructure activities, but the revenues generated by such activities shall not be taken into account when determining whether the infrastructure entity is able to meet its financial obligations.
                  4.   Where insurance or reinsurance undertakings hold material qualifying infrastructure investments or qualifying infrastructure corporate investments, they shall, when establishing the written procedures referred to in Article 41(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC, include provisions for an active monitoring of these investments during the construction phase, and for a maximisation of the amount covered from these investments in case of a work-out scenario.
                  5.   Insurance or reinsurance undertakings with a qualifying infrastructure investment or a qualifying infrastructure corporate investment in bonds or loans shall set up their asset-liability management to ensure that, on an ongoing basis, they are able to hold the investment to maturity.’.
