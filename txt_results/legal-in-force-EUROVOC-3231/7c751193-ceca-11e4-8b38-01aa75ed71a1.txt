   COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/462
   of 19 March 2015
   laying down implementing technical standards with regard to the procedures for supervisory approval to establish special purpose vehicles, for the cooperation and exchange of information between supervisory authorities regarding special purpose vehicles as well as to set out formats and templates for information to be reported by special purpose vehicles in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
   (Text with EEA relevance)
   THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
   Having regard to Directive 2009/138/EC of 25 November 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II)
    (, and in particular Article 211(2)(a) and (b) thereof,1)Whereas:
            (1)
         Special purpose vehicles require supervisory approval to be established prior to assuming risks from insurance or reinsurance undertakings. The conditions and procedures to be followed for granting and withdrawing this approval, including documentation requirements, are regulated by Directive 2009/138/EC and should be complemented by this Regulation.
            (2)
         Where a special purpose vehicle assumes risks from more than one insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the special purpose vehicle should maintain assets equal to or exceeding its aggregate maximum risk exposure taking into account each individual contractual obligation. When granting supervisory approval, the supervisory authority should assess whether this obligation is being met and consider each individual contractual arrangement and risk transfer.
            (3)
         It is important to set procedures for the cooperation and exchange of information between supervisory authorities, where the special purpose vehicle is established in a Member State which is not the Member State where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, from which it assumes risk, is established. The cooperation and exchange of information between those supervisory authorities is particularly important during the process of the supervisory approval of the special purpose vehicle. Also, if there are material changes that potentially affect the special purpose vehicle's compliance with the requirements of Article 211 of Directive 2009/138/EC and when the authorisation is withdrawn or lapses, the cooperation and exchange of information between those supervisory authorities is necessary to ensure effective and efficient supervision.
            (4)
         The supervisory reporting requirements, which are set out in Article 325 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35
             (, should enable the supervisory authorities of the special purpose vehicles to assess continued compliance with the relevant requirements. Those requirements should be complemented by the templates and formats set out in this Regulation.2)
            (5)
         For a clearer understanding of the appropriate technical rules to be laid down, it is necessary to define the term multi-arrangement special purpose vehicle.
            (6)
         This Regulation is based on the draft implementing technical standards submitted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to the Commission.
            (7)
         EIOPA has conducted open public consultations on the draft implementing technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Insurance and Reinsurance Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council
             (.3)
            (8)
         In order to enhance legal certainty about the supervisory regime during the phasing-in period provided for in Article 308a of Directive 2009/138/EC, which will start on 1 April 2015, it is important to ensure that this Regulation enters into force as soon as possible, on the day after that of its publication in the
